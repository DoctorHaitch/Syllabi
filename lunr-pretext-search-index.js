  "title": "Welcome to the Course",
  "body": " Welcome to the Course   This section introduces policies which apply to every course I teach.    Equity and Inclusion   I want you to succeed in this class! As your professor I pledge to work to create an equitable learning environment, where all students belong. Mathematics can seem like the most objective of school subjects, but like all education, mathematics education is a cultural activity.  How we experience the world outside of math classes affect how we experience math classes. There is considerable research on how students' sense of belonging in their math classes impacts their learning. Feeling like you don't belong in a class can impact your cognitive load and diminish your ability to focus on the mathematics; so for example, you might use your brain to worry whether the professor or your classmates will think you are stupid if you make a mistake; to deal with the impact of a racist, sexist, classist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist microaggression; or to wonder whether the other students are better than you.  William Yslas Vélez said, ``If a student finds pleasure and joy in finding a solution, in understanding a new concept, then this emotion is a sign of belonging to the mathematical community\" ( Imposter Syndrome , AMS e-Mentoring Network, posted 1\/25\/2019). Although frustration and struggle are also part of the mathematical enterprise, ultimately I see my work as setting up situations where all students have the opportunity to experience the joy of mathematics, to experience a sense of belonging, and to use our brains for learning math.    Student Diversity  The diversity of the participants in this course is a valuable source of ideas, problem solving strategies, and computational creativity. I consider this classroom to be a place where you will all be treated with respect, and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability – and other visible and nonvisible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.    Commitment to Anti-Racist Pedagogy  (Adapted from White Supremacy Culture Still Here by Tema Okun)  White supremacy refers to the ways in which the ruling class elite or the power elite in the colonies of what was to become the United States used the pseudo-scientific concept of race to create whiteness and a hierarchy of racialized value in order to:  disconnect and divide white people from Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC);  disconnect and divide Black, Indigenous, and People of Color from each other;  disconnect and divide white people from other white people;  disconnect and divide each and all of us from the earth, the sun, the wind, the water, the stars, the animals that roam(ed) the earth;  disconnect and divide each of us from ourselves and from Keanu Reeves .  With a commitment to dismantling white supremacy, in my courses we will :  learn to admit when we are wrong. Understand that vulnerability can be a strength, particularly if you are sitting in a position of power and privilege;  understand that discomfort is at the root of all growth and learning;  welcome discomfort and learn to sit with discomfort before responding or acting;  avoid taking everything personally; we are all just human, glory and warts and genius and faults and all;  create a culture where people feel they can bring problems to the group; use meetings as a place to solve problems, not just a place to report activities;  create a culture of inquiry about what constitutes the \"right way\" and what defines a \"mistake\";  develop your skills individually and collectively to gather information through different ways of knowing; appreciate when others learn from and expand on our knowledge and writing; see ourselves and position ourselves as one person in a stream of knowing and learning;  remember that feedback may be skillful or unskillful and either way, it will not kill you;  understand the link between defensiveness and fear (of losing power, losing face, losing comfort, losing privilege); work on our own defensiveness; ask ourselves what we are defending against and why;  learn to recognize those times when you need to go off the planned agenda in order to address people's underlying concerns with the knowledge that doing so will result in a more solid product in the long term; understand that everything takes longer than anyone expects.

  "title": "MATH122 - Calculus 2",
  "body": " MATH122 - Calculus 2   This course will cover topics in (official course catalog description) techniques of integration, applications of integration, improper integrals, numerical integration, the calculus of parametric curves, and infinite series and sequences.    Why study calculus?  This rigorous mathematical subject consists of a basic mathematical tool kit for dealing with processes that change continuously. Part of the reason that calculus turns out to be so useful is that the details of the process turn out not to matter so much -- all that matters is that the process is continuous. In fact, if the increments are small enough, discrete processes can sometimes be approximated as continuous and treated using the techniques of calculus. More specifically, Calculus is the story of infinitely improving approximations concerned with two historical problems:  The slope of a \"curvy line\" at a point.  The area beneath a \"curvy line\".  Miraculously, these two problems, which may seem barely related except for the type of line they seek to study, turn out to be deeply intertwined. This semester, we will primarily focus on the second problem, but due to the dual nature of these problems the other is necessary and a skill which you hopefully developed during Calculus I.  In order to do well in MATH122 , you need to work on developing both conceptual understanding and algebraic fluency. Conceptual understanding is necessary as memorized facts are not much help if you do not know how to use them. Algebraic fluency is required as knowing the basic concepts is not very helpful if you are unable to easily use them because your knowledge is not built on a firm foundation of the governing principles.  By fluency, I mean that you can generally use them without thinking about them. Fluency is defined as the ability to speak or write a language easily and accurately . Similar to your fluency in your native language, where you likely are fluent in 10000-20000 words, you are expected to be fluent in a number of \"mathematical rules\" which you have learned over the last several years. Note, there is a full inventory of the algebraic, trigonometric, and Calculus I skills with which you need to be fluent in (TODO:INSERT REFERENCE HERE ONCE IT IS PORTED TO PRETEXT).     Prequisites  Formally, being enrolled in MATH122 requires having passed MATH121 with a 'C' or better, or explicit consent of the instructor. Any student being found not to meet these requirements will automatically receive a failing grade at the end of the semester.  In practice, Calculus II depends heavily on algebra , analytic geometry , trigonometry and your knowledge from Calculus I . Several review worksheets are posted on D2L Brightspace to help you recall the knowledge that will help you succeed in Calculus II this semester. A list of specific material that will be used to scaffold new knowledge can be found in the Expected Prior Knowledge section. (TODO:Reference to Expected Knowledge Section).     Learning Outcomes  Upon completion of this course students will have demonstrated  a working knowledge of Riemann integration theory and several specific applications. This will build off material from MATH121: Calculus I .  a working knowledge of sequences, series, and their relevance to calculus.  their ability to memorize, derive, and practice facts (the derivatives and antiderivatives of basic functions, for instance) and fundamental theorems.  understanding what is going on behind the symbols by developing the patterns of thought and the problem-solving skills needed when dealing with problems involving continuous change and difficult integrals. If you limit yourself to memorizing facts and formulas, you will miss out on this very important part of the course, which makes calculus so important for so many application areas.  team work skills by collaborating within a small group, towards completion of a common task or goal.       Course Delivery  Sessions will be in person. Many classes will require you to complete a 'pre-class assignment' to be turned in at the start of class. Lectures will be interactive and often be interrupted or replaced by individual or small group practice. You are expected to participate in class. If you are having trouble understanding anything please feel free to raise your hand and ask about it, or discuss it with your peers during the group work times. If you are not comfortable doing this, please email me, visit my drop-in practice hours, schedule an appointment during office hours, or ask immediately after class.     Course Outline  A planned schedule for the semester is provided at the end of this document. Please see it for important dates such as quizzes and exams .  Roughly, our semester is organized to study the following questions (in order):  How can the relationships between integrals and derivatives help us model real-world phenomena? In general, how can integration help us calculate useful quantities? (Sections xx)  What can we do when the anti-derivative is not obvious? (Sections xx)  How do we work with curves that are not functions or perform Calculus in other coordinate systems? (Sections xx)  How do we deal with quantities involving infinity that still result in finite answers? (Sections xx)  Finally, when our techniques from answering (2) fail (or are impossible), can we still find meaningful answers to Calculus questions? If so, how? (Sections xx)       MavPASS  MavPASS (Peer-Facilitated Academic Support System): This semester, we are offering additional support to help students to succeed in this course. Students who have taken this class in a previous semester have been hired as MavPASS Leaders to sit in on the course with you, facilitate study sessions outside of class, and hold office hours.  Your MavPASS leader this semester is Caleb Pardeik , a student in the Computer Engineering program. Your MavPASS schedule for this semester is    Day  Time  Event  Location    Monday  10:00AM-10:50AM  MP Working Session  WH283    Wednesday  4:00PM-4:50PM  MP Working Session  WH286A    Tuesday  2:00PM-3:00PM  Office Hour  Zoom    Wednesday  1:00PM-2:00PM  Office Hour  Zoom    Note, the two Working Sessions cover the same material, so you may attend whichever is more convenient for your schedule (you do not need to attend both). You can also find the schedule at www.mnsu.edu\/mavpass . For additional information, please email mavpass@mnsu.edu .     Subsequent Courses and Programs  To give a sense of the scale, scope, and importance of Calculus II, this is the current list of courses which require Calculus II with a 'C' or better as an entry requirement. Note, for Computer Science, many of your classes list MATH247: Linear Algebra , which is dependent on Calculus II. This is likely true for other programs as well, and I'd like to get a similar list for MATH247 in the near future.     Course  Title   Course  Title    AST225  Astronomy\/Astrophysics II   MATH290  Foundations of Mathematics    CHEM101  General Chem Skills   MATH321  Ordinary Differential Equations    CHEM190  Learning in Chem Applic   STAT354  Concepts of Prob & Stats    CHEM191  Chemistry Applications   MATH461  Mathematical Theory of Interest    CHEM446  Physical Chemistry II   MATH570  Numerical Analysis I    ME281  Computing Techniques   MATH528  Linear Optimization    ME291  Engineering Analysis   PHYS335  Modern Physics I    ENGR240  Linear Circuits   PHYS457  Optics    MATH223  Calculus III   PHYS565  Computer Applicat Phys    MATH247  Linear Algebra I        Additionally, Calculus II is listed required by the following degree programs as a course or major prerequisite or Major Common Core requirement:   Program   Program    Automotive Engineering Technology (BS)   Manufacturing Engineering Technology (BS)    Biochemistry (BS)   Mathematics (BA\/BS)    Chemistry - ACS Approved (BS)   Mathematics Teaching (BS)    Civil Engineering (BSCE)   Mechanical Engineering (BSME)    Computer Engineering (BSEC)   Physics (BS)    Computer Science (BS)   Software Engineering (BS)    Electrical Engineering (BSEE)   Statistics (BS)    Integrated Engineering (BSE)   Statistics (BS) Actuarial Track     Finally, the degree programs for Biotechnology (BS) and Economics (BA\/BS) strongly recommend Calculus II for any students planning to pursue graduate or professional school.     Suggested Textbooks  The textbook officially adopted by the department for this course is:     Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals by James Stewart, edition.     ISBN : 978-1133112280    However, since the required practice will be assigned directly to you, almost any Calculus textbook will suffice. This includes any edition of Stewart’s texts, freely available Open Educational Resource (OER) options from sites like OpenStax, and others. The most important consideration is the order of topics. For example, Stewart’s textbooks typically present advanced integration techniques before the applications of integration, while this course takes the reverse approach—motivating techniques through early applications.  A textbook that follows a similar order to this course is Calculus by Larson and Edwards (currently in its 12th edition, though any edition will work). Students looking for an affordable physical textbook might consider an older edition of Larson and Edwards.  Another strong and inexpensive alternative closely aligned with the departmental textbook is:     APEX Calculus by Gregory Hartman.     ISBN : 978-1719263382    This book is freely available online and as a downloadable PDF. Print copies can typically be purchased for $15–$20 via Amazon. We will primarily cover content from Calculus 2, with a few sections drawn from Calculus 3. If you prefer a printed textbook, APEX Calculus Volume 2 is likely sufficient; the few Calculus 3 topics we cover can be accessed digitally.   Please be aware, that if you continue into Calculus 3, you may still be required to purchase the current edition of Stewart's Calculus to obtain access to the digital homework system used by other instructors. These alternatives are provided in this section as a low-cost alternative to Stewart's Calculus.     "

Maverick Textbook Reserve Program  Students who cannot or do not wish to purchase a textbook for a class may be able to utilize the Maverick Textbook Reserve Program (the Essential Calculus book by James Stewart is available). The program was created to address the financial burden of textbook costs and is offered through a partnership between Student Government, the Bookstore, and the Library.  The Maverick Textbook Reserve purchases textbooks and houses them in the library for students to check out in two-hour time blocks. To see what other books are offered, you can visit the circulation desk in the library or explore the list online:   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/mssa\/services\/mavericktextbookreserve.html      Technology   Desire2Learn LMS   This class will use MNSU's online learning management system, D2L Brightspace. All course activities and communication will generally be conducted through this platform.  Information on how to use D2L Brightspace is available on the university's website:   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/it-solutions\/locations\/instructional-design-academic-technology-services\/technology-tools-for-teaching-and-learning\/d2l-brightspace\/   You can access D2L Brightspace directly at:   https:\/\/mnsu.learn.minnstate.edu\/d2l\/login      The Mathematics & Statistics Learning Center  The Mathematics & Statistics Learning Center (MLC) offers walk-in tutoring for undergraduate math and statistics courses. Staffed by Math\/Stat majors and graduate students, the center provides a welcoming environment for working with tutors or collaborating with peers on assignments.  The MLC is located in Wissink Hall 285. A schedule will be posted on D2L when it becomes available.     Center for Academic Success  In addition to offering tutoring services for students on the main floor of Memorial Library, the Center for Academic Success maintains a list of helpful online resources:   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/academics\/academic-support\/student-support-centers\/center-for-academic-success\/math-science-and-business\/resources#item-2      Accessibility Resources  Minnesota State University, Mankato provides students with disabilities reasonable accommodation to participate in educational programs, activities, or services. These include both permanent and temporary disabilities. Students requiring accommodation to engage in class activities or meet course requirements should first register with Accessibility Resources (Memorial Library 132, telephone 389-2825, TDD 711) to establish an accommodation plan. After that, they should contact me for any needed course-specific arrangements.  You can find information on getting started at   https:\/\/mankato.mnsu.edu\/university-life\/campus-services\/accessibility-resources\/getting-started\/      Veteran's Information  Veterans and active duty military personnel with special circumstances are welcome and encouraged to communicate these. Resources for veterans are available at   https:\/\/mankato.mnsu.edu\/university-life\/campus-services\/veterans\/veterans-resource-center\/      Maverick Food Pantry  The Maverick Food Pantry is an important campus initiative that provides both perishable and non-perishable food, as well as basic toiletries, to students experiencing food insecurity. No student should have to choose between eating and learning. Good nutrition is a critical foundation for academic performance—affecting energy levels, focus, memory, and overall well-being.  If you're not getting enough to eat, it can significantly hinder your ability to concentrate, retain information, and stay motivated. Addressing food insecurity is not just about physical health—it's about supporting your success as a student. The Maverick Food Pantry exists to ensure that all students have the fuel they need to thrive academically and personally.  More information about eligibility, hours, and how to access the pantry can be found at   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/university-life\/campus-services\/maverick-food-pantry\/     "

I'm Dr. Hollingsworth (call me Dr. !), and I am a new(ish) Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics within Minnesota State University, Mankato. I grew up in the Ozark Mountains in North Central Arkansas, and I spent a lot of time outdoors hiking, bicycling, and hammock camping. I don't get a lot of time for hiking or camping these days, but I still commute to campus by bicycle or electric kick-scooter almost every day.  I started homeschooling after sixth grade, with almost no math curriculum. Consequently, I didn't really start learning mathematics until I started at the community college when I was 25.    Before that, I spent 6 years as a (self-taught) computer programmer working primarily on transportation and logistics software for line haul trucking companies, followed by 2 years as a freelance photographer (My favorite CV line item from this time is being published in a magazine titled Blood & Thunder !). At school, I started as a business major with a minor in studio art, and the major quickly changed to mathematics. I eventually transfered and graduated from the University of Central Arkansas with a BA in Mathematics and a minor in studio art (mostly printmaking and ceramics). After taking a year off to teach at a community college, I went to the University of Delaware for my Master's and Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics, writing my dissertation on the underlying mathematical framework for high-dimensional signal processing and studying constructions of such schemes. Now, I spend a lot of time crafting materials for the courses I teach (like this one!) and do my best to help students succeed.  I have lived in North Mankato for two years now with my amazing partner and our dog Gemma. We all enjoy cooking (well, Gemma enjoys eating), reading, and bicycling. We enjoy good coffee (we use an Aeropress) and I enjoy cleaning, although neither of the other two do. Most of my free time\/weekends are spent on home-improvement projects.   On campus, I am teaching two sections of MATH122 Calculus II and one section of MATH605 Graphs and Algorithms. I am also  running a math playground at the Children's Museum of Southern Minnesota and writing a book on Algebraic Combinatorics and Optimization. I stay busy!  You can follow my dog Gemma's personal adventures on her Instagram (@GemmaIsAGoodGirl), which just shows you that my dog is better at social media than I am. However, you can find me online through my website (woefully in need of updating) at sites.google.com\/view\/math-kgh .  "
