  "title": "General Course Policies",
  "body": " General Course Policies   This section provides policies and advice on how to best use them which apply to every course I teach, along with some general observations on why students should study mathematics and take that study seriously.    Why Study Math?  One of the most common questions I get when people find out I teach mathematics is: “Why should anyone study math?” It’s a fair question—and one worth exploring seriously, especially for students in STEM fields. Mathematics isn’t just about numbers or equations; it’s a foundational discipline that trains your brain, shapes your thinking, and helps you understand the world in a deeper and more structured way. Here are a few key reasons why studying mathematics is valuable—regardless of your eventual career path.    Mathematics is the basic language of science: Math is the language through which we describe patterns, relationships, and phenomena in nearly every scientific field—from physics and engineering to biology and economics. Gaining fluency in this language takes time, practice, and effort—just like learning to speak any other language. But once you speak math, you unlock the ability to express complex ideas with clarity and precision.    It develops powerful problem-solving skills: Mathematics is a training ground for your mind. Every problem you tackle requires you to interpret given information, analyze relationships, identify patterns, and pursue a logical strategy toward a solution. This process is excellent preparation not just for exams, but for real-world situations where you need to solve unfamiliar problems with limited information.  Additionally, math helps cultivate habits of mind : persistence, attention to detail, critical thinking, and adaptability. One key challenge students face in problem-solving is the Einstellung effect (see note below)—a tendency to rely too heavily on familiar methods even when better options exist. Mathematical practice helps you recognize and overcome these mental traps, making you a more flexible and creative thinker.    Mathematics is inherently beautiful: Math is not just useful—it’s also an art form. Writers like Dante, Melville, and Lewis Carroll wove mathematical themes into their literature. Artists such as da Vinci, Escher, and Kandinsky used mathematical structures to inspire their work. The study of mathematics allows you to see hidden patterns, symmetry, and elegance in the world around you. Even if you don’t pursue a mathematical career, learning to appreciate this beauty can enrich your thinking and your life.    The Einstellung effect: Also known as cognitive fixation , this is a psychological phenomenon where prior experience with a particular type of solution makes it harder to see better or more efficient alternatives. It’s a cognitive bias that causes us to stick with familiar approaches—even when they no longer work. In math courses, this often arises after solving many similar problems, and then encountering a new problem that breaks the expected pattern. The only way to consistently overcome this bias is through deliberate practice, reflection, and a willingness to adapt your approach.  The general policies presented in this section are designed to support students on their journey in mathematical training.     Course Feedback and Grade Tracking  Feedback is an essential component of the learning process in this course. Marked assignments are typically returned during regular class meetings. If you are absent on a day when feedback is distributed—usually when the next graded assessment is returned—you will need to either wait until the following distribution day or visit the instructor during office hours to collect your graded work.  Grades will be recorded directly on your returned assignments and may or may not be posted to D2L. You are responsible for tracking your own progress throughout the semester. Keeping a personal record of your scores will help you stay informed, monitor your performance, and make strategic decisions about your study habits.  As students in a mathematics course, you are expected to be able to calculate your own course grade using the weight structure provided in the course syllabus. In most of the instructor’s courses, exam grades are weighted using a flexible structure: your highest exam score receives the greatest weight, and your lowest exam score the least. This policy is intended to reflect that all course material is important, while also recognizing that students may have an off day. The goal is to reward consistent performance and reduce the impact of a single poor test result. Because most online gradebooks do not support this type of weighting, your final grade cannot be automatically calculated in the course Learning Management System.  If you have questions about how to interpret feedback, calculate your course grade, or improve your performance based on instructor comments, you are strongly encouraged to attend office hours or reach out via email. Making use of feedback is a key part of your success in this course.     Effective Use of Office Hours  Office hours are one of the most valuable resources available to you in any of your courses. They are dedicated times when you can meet with your instructor to ask questions, clarify concepts, and receive individualized support. You are strongly encouraged to take advantage of them, whether you're struggling, curious, or simply want to stay on track. Here are some effective ways to use office hours:    Get help with homework or assigned problems: Bring questions about specific problems you've attempted and want help understanding or solving.    Clarify difficult concepts from class: If something from lecture didn’t fully make sense, office hours are a great time to revisit and reinforce those ideas.    Explore how topics connect across courses: Discuss how the current material relates to what you’ve learned in previous math classes or how it might apply in future courses or real-world contexts.    Get advice on effective study strategies: Learn how to take better notes, manage time, approach problem sets, and prepare for exams in a way that suits this course’s structure.    Ask about academic or career pathways: Whether you're considering a math major, teaching certification, or a STEM-related field, office hours are a chance to get informed advice.    Review feedback from graded assignments: Discuss mistakes you made and ask questions about how to improve or approach similar problems differently in the future.    Build rapport with your instructor: Forming a professional relationship can help you feel more comfortable asking questions and may lead to future opportunities like recommendation letters or research experiences.    You do not need to have a specific question prepared to attend office hours—sometimes simply talking through material aloud with your instructor can help clarify your thinking. Feel free to request a joint appointment with one or two classmates if you're working through the same material.  There are three drop-in office hours as shown in . I also reserve several hours a week specifically for responding to student emails. All other times are available by appointment to allow for flexibility and to make the best use of the instructor's time across teaching, grading, student communication, and other university responsibilities. This model also helps ensure that the instructor meets the university’s 10-hour weekly student availability requirement in a sustainable and effective way.  Appointments can be scheduled by emailing your instructor at kristopher (dot) hollingsworth (at) mnsu (dot) edu . You may schedule individually or as a small group if you'd prefer to review material collaboratively.  If you happen to see the instructor's office door open, you are welcome to check in and ask if now is a good time for questions. However, please be aware that the instructor may be busy with other responsibilities, and students with scheduled appointments will be given priority.     Late Work and Missed Assessments   Missed Assignments: Assignments in this course are intentionally designed to help you prepare for upcoming assessments and to deepen your understanding of key concepts. To ensure fairness and maintain academic integrity, solutions or feedback are often shared on or shortly after the original due date. For this reason, late submissions will not be accepted for any assignment once solutions have been released, the relevant assessment has taken place, or graded work has been returned.  If you are unable to attend class on the day an assignment is due, you may email a digital copy to the instructor before class begins to timestamp your submission. The physical copy should then be submitted at the next class meeting.  Because late submissions create additional grading and administrative overhead, they are subject to a cumulative penalty: the first late assignment will be accepted at full credit; the second will receive a 25% deduction; the third, a 50% deduction; and the fourth and all subsequent late submissions will receive no credit. Additionally, late work will be placed at the bottom of the grading queue. While every effort will be made to provide feedback, timely grading is not guaranteed, and in rare cases, late work may not be graded until the week of final exams.  Submitting work on time is essential for staying on track with the course and for benefiting fully from instructor feedback. Meeting deadlines ensures that material is completed while it is still relevant and that you are well-prepared for future assessments. Delays often result in missed opportunities for reflection, clarification, and academic growth.  Students are expected to manage their time responsibly and communicate proactively. If you anticipate a conflict or difficulty meeting a deadline due to extenuating circumstances, you must contact the instructor in advance to discuss possible accommodations. Requests made after a deadline will generally not be considered unless otherwise stated in an individual assignment or course policy.  An exception to this policy applies to University-Sanctioned Events, as described in . In such cases, students must communicate in advance to make arrangements for meeting assignment deadlines or completing alternate work.   Missed Exams: Exams may be made up only during the same calendar week as the university’s final exam period. No other make-up opportunities will be offered. Shorter assessments may be eligible for make-up during office hours or through department provided proctoring at the instructor’s discretion.  To request a make-up, students must email the instructor as soon as possible after missing the scheduled assessment. No documentation is required or expected—timely communication is sufficient.  This policy ensures consistency and fairness while accommodating occasional, unavoidable conflicts. Consolidating make-ups into the final exam week helps maintain instructional continuity and supports efficient grading throughout the semester.     Attendance and Emergency Preparedness  Regular attendance is expected in each class, as much of the learning will occur through in-class activities and collaboration with peers. However, I recognize that students may occasionally face disruptions due to communicable illnesses (such as COVID-19 or measles), extreme weather, or other unexpected events.  If you need to miss class, please notify the instructor as early as possible. When appropriate, we will work together to develop a plan for staying on track with course material and assignments.  Students are expected to maintain an average attendance rate of 90% or higher . Consistent absences without communication may prompt outreach from the instructor and\/or your academic advisor. Note: Students with attendance rates below 85% have historically been at significantly higher risk of failing the course.    Emergency Preparedness   This course is designed with flexibility in mind to accommodate emergencies such as severe weather, public health events, and other unexpected disruptions.   Weather or Campus Closures: If Minnesota State University, Mankato cancels classes due to inclement weather or other emergencies, a recorded lecture will be posted to D2L in place of the in-person meeting. In the event of an instructor-initiated cancellation, you will be notified via email as early as possible, and the change will also be posted on D2L. For official updates, please consult the university’s emergency notification site: http:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/security\/emergencies\/weatherclosingshtml.html .   Public Health: This course will follow evolving guidance from the university and public health authorities. As of now, masks are not required in the classroom, but this may change during the semester depending on university policy. Students are expected to respect each other’s health decisions and contribute to an inclusive and supportive learning environment.  If you are feeling unwell, you should stay home or wear a mask to class to protect yourself and your peers. All course policies are subject to change in response to updated guidance. In the event of widespread health concerns, courses will shift modalities or expectations in accordance with university policy.     Comments on AI Usage and Academic Integrity   Artificial Intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT and other language models, are now widely accessible and increasingly powerful. They can assist with a range of academic tasks, from generating ideas to solving problems and drafting responses. Used thoughtfully, they can be a meaningful part of your learning process. However, they are not a replacement for learning itself.  Professionals in fields such as computer science, economics, engineering, and physics have raised concerns about over-reliance on AI. A common theme is that foundational skills—critical thinking, problem solving, and conceptual understanding—are not being sufficiently developed. These are the very skills that allow experts to adapt when tools fail, when new techniques are needed, or when a deeper understanding is required. Without them, you may find yourself unprepared in real-world situations where AI alone is not enough.  Responsible use of AI involves a thoughtful feedback loop: asking good questions, interpreting AI-generated output with a critical eye, cross-checking with your own understanding, and revising based on insight. Simply copying or submitting AI-generated work short-circuits this process. It not only raises concerns about academic integrity—it also undermines your ability to grow intellectually and professionally.  As your instructor, I recognize that AI is now part of the educational landscape. My goal is not to police its use, but to encourage its integration in ways that support genuine learning. I want you to graduate not only with a degree, but with the habits of mind that will sustain you in a rapidly changing world.  Your education is not a series of tasks to complete—it is a process of becoming. Learning to think for yourself is central to that process. When you avoid the struggle of learning by outsourcing it to an algorithm, you miss the opportunity to strengthen the very skills that education is meant to develop.  AI can be a powerful partner in your education, but it must be used with care and integrity. Use it to clarify concepts, explore alternatives, and deepen your understanding—but do not let it think for you. Let it be a tool in your feedback loop, not a substitute for it.  This course is designed to challenge you—not to discourage you, but to help you build the resilience and skill needed in any meaningful career or intellectual pursuit. You have the opportunity now to cultivate the habits that will serve you for a lifetime. Don't trade long-term growth for short-term convenience.  Let's engage honestly, think critically, and use the best tools available—including AI—with responsibility and purpose.    "

  "title": "MATH122 - Calculus 2",
  "body": " MATH122 - Calculus 2   This course builds on your foundation in calculus by introducing advanced integration techniques, applications of integration, improper integrals, numerical methods, calculus of parametric curves, and infinite sequences and series. These topics are core analytical tools used throughout science, engineering, and applied mathematics.  If some of this terminology is unfamiliar, that's expected, you're taking this course to start learning these concepts! The first section below outlines the kinds of problems and questions these concepts help us address—from modeling physical systems to analyzing complex data. By the end of the course, you'll have a basic understanding of how calculus might help with rigorous problem-solving in STEM fields.  In addition to mastering these new topics, you'll continue to reinforce fluency with essential skills from arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and Calculus I. These fundamentals remain critical across the sciences for precisely quantifying and interpreting relationships in real-world systems.    Course Outline  A planned schedule for the semester will be provided on D2L during the first or second week of class. This second semester course in the standard three-semester sequence will cover Chapters 6 through 9 of the textbook officially adopted by our department as described in , although almost any modern Calculus textbook will serve for this section of the course. Please refer to the schedule for important dates such as quizzes and exams .  Roughly, our semester is organized to study the following questions (in order):   How can the relationships between integrals and derivatives help us model real-world phenomena? In general, how can integration help us calculate useful quantities?   Sections 7.7: Intro to DEs; 7.1: Area Between Curves; 7.2: Volumes; 7.3: Cyl. Shells     What can we do when the anti-derivative is not obvious?   Sections 6.1: IBP; 6.3: Partial Fractions; 6.2: Trig Integrals and General Substitutions     How do we work with curves that are not functions or perform Calculus in other coordinate systems?  Sections 9.1: Parametric Curves; 9.2: Calc. on Parametric Curves; 7.4 & 9.2: Arc Length; 9.3: Polar Coordinates; 9.4: Areas and Lengths in Polar    How do we deal with quantities involving infinity that still result in finite answers?  Sections 8.1: Sequences; 8.2: Series; 6.6: Improper Integrals; 8.3: Integral Test; 8.4: Alternating Series Test and Absolute Convergence; 8.4: Ratio\/Root Tests    Finally, when our techniques from answering (2) fail (or are impossible), can we still find meaningful answers to Calculus questions? If so, how?  Sections 8.5: Power Series; 8.6: Fxns as Power Series; 8.7: Taylor and Maclaurin Series; 8.8: Appl. of Taylor Polynomials        Why study calculus?  This rigorous mathematical subject consists of a basic mathematical tool kit for dealing with processes that change continuously. Part of the reason that calculus turns out to be so useful is that the details of the process turn out not to matter so much -- all that matters is that the process is continuous. In fact, if the increments are small enough, discrete processes can sometimes be approximated as continuous and treated using the techniques of calculus. More specifically, Calculus is the story of infinitely improving approximations concerned with two historical problems:  The slope of a \"curvy line\" at a point.  The area beneath a \"curvy line\".  Miraculously, these two problems, which may seem barely related except for the type of line they seek to study, turn out to be deeply intertwined. This semester, we will primarily focus on the second problem, but due to the dual nature of these problems the other is necessary and a skill which you hopefully developed during Calculus I.  In order to do well in MATH122 , you need to work on developing both conceptual understanding and algebraic fluency. Conceptual understanding is necessary as memorized facts are not much help if you do not know how to use them. Algebraic fluency is required as knowing the basic concepts is not very helpful if you are unable to easily use them because your knowledge is not built on a firm foundation of the governing principles.  By fluency, I mean that you can generally use them without thinking about them. Fluency is defined as the ability to speak or write a language easily and accurately . Similar to your fluency in your native language, where you likely are fluent in 10000-20000 words, you are expected to be fluent in a number of \"mathematical rules\" which you have learned over the last several years. In , there is a full inventory of the algebraic, trigonometric, and Calculus I skills with which you need to be fluent to be truly successful in this and future courses.     Prequisites  Formally, being enrolled in MATH122 requires having passed MATH121 with a 'C' or better, or explicit consent of the instructor. Any student being found not to meet these requirements will automatically receive a failing grade at the end of the semester.  In practice, Calculus II depends heavily on algebra , analytic geometry , trigonometry and your knowledge from Calculus I . Several review worksheets are posted on D2L Brightspace to help you recall the knowledge that will help you succeed in Calculus II this semester. A list of specific material that will be used to scaffold new knowledge can be found in the Prerequisite Knowledge for Calculus II section: .     Learning Outcomes  Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  Demonstrate a conceptual understanding and computational proficiency in Riemann integration theory, including its specific applications such as area, volume, and physical modeling.  Analyze and work with sequences and series, including power series and Taylor expansions, demonstrating both their mathematical structure and their application to problems in calculus.  Accurately recall and apply key calculus formulas and theorems, such as derivatives and antiderivatives of standard functions, while also demonstrating the ability to derive and interpret these results.  Solve complex calculus problems by developing persistence, mathematical reasoning, and problem-solving strategies that go beyond memorization—focusing on understanding the underlying concepts of continuous change and integration techniques.  Communicate mathematical reasoning clearly and effectively, both verbally and in writing, using appropriate terminology and notation.  Collaborate effectively with peers in group settings to explore ideas, solve problems, and achieve common learning goals.  Gain confidence in using mathematics to model, analyze, and solve real-world problems in science, engineering, and other fields.       Course Engagement and Delivery  This course will be delivered in person. Active engagement is essential to your success, and students are expected to participate fully during each class session. Most class periods will include lectures punctuated by individual or small-group problem solving. Students will regularly be asked to suggest next steps or provide answers during worked examples. In some sessions, collaborative group work may fully replace lecture.  Continuous engagement with this course is essential to learning the material and achieving the course learning outcomes. You are expected to check D2L Brightspace at least once every 24 hours on weekdays. While we understand that you have commitments outside this class, to be successful in this course you should plan to work on it every school day.  Early in the semester, frequent pre-class assignments will be assigned, with additional ones distributed periodically throughout the term. These are due at the beginning of the next class period. Pre-class assignments are intended to prepare you for in-class activities, reinforce recent material, assess your progress in writing clear mathematical solutions, and support long-term goals such as the final project by breaking them into manageable stages.  There are frequent deadlines posted in D2L, and it is your responsibility to keep track of all due dates. You are encouraged to work ahead of those deadlines whenever possible to avoid last-minute issues. Regular attendance at all lecture meetings is expected and strongly contributes to your success.  You are encouraged to ask questions whenever you encounter difficulties. You may raise your hand during class, talk with peers during group work, or seek assistance outside of class. If you are more comfortable seeking help privately, you are welcome to email the instructor, attend office hours (either individually or in a small group), schedule a one-on-one meeting, or ask questions immediately after class.  If you are unable to attend class or participate due to serious illness (including COVID-19 or other health conditions), you should contact your instructor as soon as possible to make arrangements. You should also reach out to Accessibility Resources to explore appropriate accommodations.  For special situations or long-term accommodations, students are encouraged to seek assistance from the appropriate university offices. These include, but are not limited to: Accessibility Resources , Student Government , and the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access .     Licensure Standards  Students enrolled in MATH 122 – Calculus II at Minnesota State University, Mankato demonstrate competencies aligned with the Minnesota teacher licensure standards, as outlined in Minnesota Rule 8710.4600 . This course is part of the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Teaching program and addresses the following standard components:   Standard 3A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  Standard 3B: 4  Standard 3C: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8  Standard 3D: 1–5, 7–15  Standard 3G: 1a–d, 2a–c, 3a–c, 4a–d  Standard 3H: 1, 2, 3a–d   The course content includes techniques and applications of integration, improper integrals, numerical methods, parametric equations, and infinite series and sequences. These align with competencies in the following areas:   Understanding of Number Systems : Includes whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers. Calculus specific studies analytic properties of the real number system, and sequences and series are related to both the reals and integers.  Application of Mathematical Procedures : Emphasizes recognizing patterns, analyzing variable relationships, and applying limits and boundedness in sequences and series.  Use of Mathematical Representations : Focuses on solving problems using tables, graphs, algebraic expressions, and verbal descriptions.  Application of Calculus Concepts : Covers differential and integral calculus, including infinite series and their representations.   This content is integrated with pedagogy through courses such as MATH484 – Technology in Secondary School Mathematics and MATH485 – Teaching Secondary School Mathematics , equipping future educators with both subject knowledge and effective instructional strategies.  By meeting the standards above, MATH122 – Calculus II plays a key role in preparing students to meet Minnesota licensure requirements and excel as secondary mathematics teachers.      MavPASS  MavPASS (Peer-Facilitated Academic Support System): This semester, we are offering additional support to help students to succeed in this course. Students who have taken this class in a previous semester have been hired as MavPASS Leaders to sit in on the course with you, facilitate study sessions outside of class, and hold office hours.  Your MavPASS leader this semester is Caleb Pardeik , a student in the Computer Engineering program. Your MavPASS schedule for this semester is    Day  Time  Event  Location    Tuesday  6:00PM-6:50PM  MP Working Session  WH288    Thursday  12:00PM-12:50PM  MP Working Session  ML101B    Monday  6:00-7:00PM  Office Hour  Zoom    Thursday  4:00-5:00PM  Office Hour  Zoom    Note, the two Working Sessions cover the same material, so you may attend whichever is more convenient for your schedule (you do not need to attend both, but you are welcome to, however only one per week may be used to earn Learning Problem points). You can also find the schedule at www.mnsu.edu\/mavpass . For additional information, please email mavpass@mnsu.edu .     Subsequent Courses and Programs  To give a sense of the scale, scope, and importance of Calculus II, this is the current list of courses which require Calculus II with a 'C' or better as an entry requirement. Note, for Computer Science, many of your classes list MATH247: Linear Algebra , which is dependent on Calculus II. This is likely true for other programs as well, and I'd like to get a similar list for MATH247 in the near future.         Course  Title  Course  Title    AST225  Astronomy\/Astrophysics II  MATH290  Foundations of Mathematics    CHEM101  General Chem Skills  MATH321  Ordinary Differential Equations    CHEM190  Learning in Chem Applic  STAT354  Concepts of Prob & Stats    CHEM191  Chemistry Applications  MATH461  Mathematical Theory of Interest    CHEM446  Physical Chemistry II  MATH570  Numerical Analysis I    ME281  Computing Techniques  MATH528  Linear Optimization    ME291  Engineering Analysis  PHYS335  Modern Physics I    ENGR240  Linear Circuits  PHYS457  Optics    MATH223  Calculus III  PHYS565  Computer Applicat Phys    MATH247  Linear Algebra I       Additionally, Calculus II is listed required by the following degree programs as a course or major prerequisite or Major Common Core requirement:     Program  Program    Automotive Engineering Technology (BS)  Manufacturing Eng. Technology (BS)    Biochemistry (BS)  Mathematics (BA\/BS)    Chemistry - ACS Approved (BS)  Mathematics Teaching (BS)    Civil Engineering (BSCE)  Mechanical Engineering (BSME)    Computer Engineering (BSEC)  Physics (BS)    Computer Science (BS)  Software Engineering (BS)    Electrical Engineering (BSEE)  Statistics (BS)    Integrated Engineering (BSE)  Statistics (BS) Actuarial Track     Finally, the degree programs for Biotechnology (BS) and Economics (BA\/BS) strongly recommend Calculus II for any students planning to pursue graduate or professional school.     Suggested Textbooks  The textbook officially adopted by the department for this course is:     Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals by James Stewart, edition.     ISBN : 978-1133112280    However, since the Learning Problems will be given as PDF files on D2L BrightSpace, almost any Calculus textbook will suffice. This includes any edition of Stewart's texts, freely available Open Educational Resource (OER) options from sites like OpenStax, and others. The most important consideration is the order of topics. For example, Stewart's textbooks typically present advanced integration techniques before the applications of integration, while this course takes the reverse approach—motivating techniques through early applications.  A textbook that follows a similar order to this course is Calculus by Larson and Edwards (currently in its 12th edition, though any edition will work). Students looking for an affordable physical textbook might consider an older edition of Larson and Edwards.  Another strong and inexpensive alternative closely aligned with the departmental textbook is:     APEX Calculus by Gregory Hartman.     ISBN : 978-1719263382    This book is freely available online and as a downloadable PDF. Print copies can typically be purchased for $15–$20 via Amazon. We will primarily cover content from Calculus 2, with a few sections drawn from Calculus 3. If you prefer a printed textbook, APEX Calculus Volume 2 is likely sufficient; the few Calculus 3 topics we cover can be accessed digitally.   Please be aware, that if you continue into Calculus 3, you may still be required to purchase the current edition of Stewart's Calculus to obtain access to the digital homework system used by other instructors. These alternatives are provided in this section as a low-cost alternative to Stewart's Calculus.      Earned Letter Grades   You will earn the following letter grade based on the calculation of your weighted course average based on your demonstration of course learning objections through course assessments.           Letter Grade  Weighted Average  Letter Grade  Weighted Average  Letter Grade  Weighted Average    A  [92,100]  B-  [77,80)  D  [62,65)    A-  [88,92)  C+  [74,77)  D-  [59,62)    B+  [84,88)  C  [70,74)  F  [0,59)    B  [80,84)  D+  [65,70)      For a general interpretation of grade letters and how they are designed to reflect your understanding of the material and preparedness for future courses, see .     Course Assessments   Your final grade in this course will be based on your demonstrated understanding of the course learning outcomes, as shown through a variety of assessments. The table below shows each assessment type along with its weight toward your final grade. Descriptions for each assessment follow the table.       Assessment  Weight  Description    Foundations Assessment 1  5%  Take-home quiz focused on foundational algebra skills. Open-resource.    Foundations Assessment 2  2.5%  In-class quiz testing memorized facts and their applications.    Group Participation  5%  Active participation and engagement in class groupwork activities.    Preclass Assignments  5%  Short tasks assessing mathematical writing, foundational knowledge, and readiness for class activities.    Learning Problems Journal  7.5%  Homework journal tracking progress on assigned problem sets posted on D2L.    Quizzes (5)  20%  In-class quizzes on recent material. Your lowest score will be dropped.    Exams (3)  40%  (17% + 13% + 10%) Chapter-based exams covering material from class, practice problems, and quizzes.    Final Project  15%  A creative final presentation summarizing your learning. See description below.    Final Exam  ---  Optional: May replace your lowest exam score (better or worse). You can choose to have it graded after completing it.     I am more interested in your reasoning than just your final answers. In real-world problem solving—especially in STEM—understanding the process is often more important than getting the \"right\" number. That’s why many out-of-class assignments include final answers: your focus should be on how to get there.  On quizzes and exams, minimal partial credit will be given unless your work includes clear, logical steps. I want to see how you’re thinking—not just what you concluded.  While not every technique we cover will apply equally to every major, the mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills you develop will benefit you in future courses. Mastering core competencies—such as algebraic manipulation, structured reasoning, and communication—will serve you well far beyond this class.  My goal is to help you build both confidence and competence in mathematical thinking. These are lifelong skills with value across all scientific and technical fields.    Foundations Assessment 1  This is a take-home quiz. You may use resources such as your textbook, tutoring services, office hours, or group study. It will be handed out on the first day of class and is due on Thursday of the first week.    Foundations Assessment 2  This in-class quiz will take place on the first Friday of the semester. A sample version will be posted on D2L on the first day. Most of the quiz will closely resemble this sample, with only small variations. You are expected to have key facts and procedures memorized and ready for quick recall.    Group Participation  During most class meetings, you'll work in small groups to solve problems, explore new ideas, and deepen your understanding of course concepts. Your participation grade is based on meaningful contributions to group discussions and collaborative tasks.  This includes being prepared, staying engaged, helping your teammates, and working through challenges together. Active participation benefits not only your learning but also supports the group as a whole.    Preclass Assignments  Preclass Assignments are brief tasks designed to assess your mathematical writing, reinforce foundational knowledge, and support exploration of key course competencies and their connections.  A Preclass Assignment will be assigned for each class meeting during the first two weeks of the semester. These early assignments serve several purposes: to gauge your initial knowledge and skills, to help you understand course expectations, to encourage daily practice habits, to provide early and frequent feedback, and to allow both you and the instructor to make timely adjustments. These assignments also help the instructor determine whether early progress reports or additional academic support may be necessary for any students.  As the semester progresses, Preclass Assignments will occassionally be assigned on Fridays (due the following Monday) or on Tuesdays (due the following Thursday), and are generally only scheduled on days without other major assessments. These assignments are meant to sustain regular engagement with the material and ensure you are prepared for in-class activities.   Repeated late submissions will not be accepted. For details, refer to the full late work policy in .  Each Preclass Assignment is graded on a 4-point scale: 3 points for thoughtful completion and 1 point for mathematical correctness.    Learning Problems Journal  You will keep a journal to document your work on the Learning Problems sets assigned on D2L for each topic of the course. While lectures will initially introduce you to key concepts and ideas, the real learning happens when you actively engage with the Learning Problems. Lectures outline what to do; the Learning Problems give you the variety, practice, and repetition needed to figure out how to actually do it.  These sets are graded for completion: 1 point for completing at least 50–70%, and 2 points for completing more than 70%. These completion levels are strong indicators of overall success in the course. If you're aiming for a high grade (especially an A), you are strongly encouraged to complete all problems thoroughly and on time, and to carefully write out clear, organized solutions in your journal.  Your journal must be submitted for review at each quiz and exam. These are the only real deadlines for the Learning Problems, although suggested target dates will be posted with each set to help prevent them from piling up. Submitting your journal allows me to monitor your progress and provide feedback when necessary.  Many of my previous Calculus II students offer the following advice:   Start each Learning Problem set the day the material is introduced, even if you don’t finish it right away.  Use the problems to uncover your questions early—don’t wait until the night before a quiz.  If you get stuck, don’t stay stuck. Ask Dr. H, visit the MLC or library tutors, or attend a MavPASS session.  Do the problems yourself—reading solutions or watching videos is not a substitute for active practice.   To be eligible to revise exams for partial credit, you must have mostly completed all assigned Learning Problem sets relevant to the exam. You can also earn up to two Learning Problems points per week by attending MavPASS sessions. Later in the semester, if appropriate, I may allow students to apply excess Learning Problem points toward limited exceptions to course policies—such as extensions on late assignments or removal of absences from the attendance record.    Quizzes  These will consist of 2-4 problems from the indicated sections. These problems are similar to those found on the Learning Problems sets, in-class groupworks, or preclass assignments. Often I may allow questions immediately before the quiz, with the quiz taking approximately half of the class period. If time allows, we may immediately review some or all of the quiz for the remainder of the class period. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped when calculating your final course mark at the end of the semester.    Exams  About one week prior to each chapter exam, a practice problem set will be posted. These sets will include approximately 80 problems, some of which will appear directly on the exam. If you have been consistently completing the Learning Problems sets, this packet will serve as effective review and reinforcement.  However, if you have not completed the ongoing practice, it is not realistic to expect that you can work through the entire problem set in the time available. Instead, use it strategically: scan through the problems to identify content areas where you feel uncertain or cannot immediately determine how to begin. If you find yourself unable to sketch out a general solution process for a problem, that topic likely needs further review.  To reinforce these areas, you are encouraged to bring questions from the packet to academic support resources such as MavPASS sessions, the Math and Statistics Learning Center, office hours, or the Center for Academic Success. For more information on these resources, see .  Exams will be completed in class and will follow a traditional format. Approximately 50% of each exam will consist of problems taken directly from the study packet. The remaining questions will be drawn from or modeled on problems from the Learning Problems sets, Preclass Assignments, Groupwork Assignments, and Quizzes.    Exam Revisions  Students who are meeting course expectations will have the opportunity to earn back partial credit by submitting written reflections and corrected solutions after receiving a graded exam. This revision process is designed to reinforce understanding and promote deeper learning, as well as allowing students to learn from their mistakes.  To be eligible for exam revision credit, students must meet the following requirements:    Maintain an average class attendance of at least 85% .    Earn all Learning Problems points (70% completion) of material relevant to the exam.    You may substitute some partially or incomplete sessions by attending MavPASS sessions , at most 2 points per week.    As your instructor, I fully expect you to make mistakes—that’s part of the learning process. However, it remains essential that you approach each exam with serious preparation and genuine effort. Revisions are not a substitute for studying; they are a structured opportunity to reflect on your performance, identify patterns in your understanding, and strengthen the academic habits that support long-term success.  The revision process is designed to help you engage more deeply with the material and to develop critical skills such as self-assessment, persistence, and metacognitive awareness. If one or more exams do not go as planned, revisions allow you to recover some credit while learning how to better prepare for future assessments.  That said, revisions should not be viewed as a fallback or safety net. Students who rely on revisions instead of putting forth their best effort from the outset often fall behind in the course and struggle to catch up. Use revisions as a learning tool—not a crutch. The goal is not just to improve your grade, but to grow as an independent and resilient learner.    Final Project  For your final project, you will produce a creative work summarizing your learning throughout the semester. You will briefly (1-2 minutes each) present your work the last day of class. This presentation should be a brief description of the project, challenges encountered and overcome (or not), and key takeaways from your project.  In prior semesters, students have produced paintings, sculptures, short films, children's books, board games, novellas, infographics, comic books, five-paragraph essays, and slide presentation. ( Fair warning: These last two have tended to fair the worst on meeting the project goals...).  The primary goal of your final project is to summarize your learning from the semester and organize your thoughts about the material and how various topics throughout the semester are related . Your chosen format can elevate or denigrate the information you choose to include.  A rubric for this project will be posted about halfway through the semester to help guide you in executing your project.    Final Exam  I consider the purpose of a final exam to be for students to revisit their learning from throughout the semester with the broad perspective they've gained by completing all course work. We must present information in a particular order, but information is often not strictly linear. You will often find new insights on early course material from things learned late in the term. Similarly, you may re-evaluate later knowledge having refreshed topics from early in the semester.  Given this perspective on finals, much of this is instead accomplished by your final project. Consequently, the final exam in this class is optional -- you may use it to replace one prior exam score, which is particularly helpful if you had an off-day or exceptionally busy week when one of the prior exams occured. Note, you may take the exam first and then decide wether or not it should be graded based on if you think you did better or worse than your previous lowest exam mark. If you choose to have the final exam graded, it will replace your lowest exam score, better or worse.      Prerequisite Knowledge for Calculus II    Learning   Learning is cumulative--but so are misconceptions.   Christopher Danielson   This document was originally created in Fall 2023 and will be updated as needed. If you have suggestions or feedback, I’d be glad to hear from you—your input is always welcome!  The purpose of this list is not to teach you the concepts from scratch. Rather, it serves as a comprehensive reminder of the topics you’ve already studied and will need to use fluently in Calculus II. Your textbook, online resources, and other references will likely assume you know these topics, which means they often won’t be explicitly explained in problems or solutions—even those found online. This list provides the names and brief descriptions of key concepts to help you identify any gaps in your understanding. It is your responsibility to ensure you're prepared to apply them whenever they arise, both in this course and beyond.  What follows is a curated list of foundational topics that students often need in order to succeed in Calculus II. For each, I’ve noted where you likely first encountered it, though you've probably seen them multiple times since. This goes well beyond the general prerequisite of \"Completed Calculus I with a C or better.\" These are the specific pieces of knowledge you'll be expected to build upon. Struggling with these concepts is a common reason students find Calculus II challenging. You've invested many years into learning mathematics up to this point—you’re now expected to master and apply these ideas fluently.

  "title": "MATH605 - Graphs and Algorithms",
  "body": " MATH605 - Graphs and Algorithms   This course introduces students to linear programming techniques, with a particular emphasis on the simplex algorithm and its applications in combinatorial optimization. Topics include fractional relaxations of classical graph parameters such as the vertex cover number, independence number, chromatic number, and matching number, as well as Delsarte’s linear programming bound in the context of association schemes and coding theory.  Time permitting, we will also explore the fundamentals of semidefinite programming and its role in combinatorial optimization, through topics such as Lovász’s theta function for Shannon capacity, the Goemans-Williamson approximation algorithm for Max-Cut, and Schrijver’s contributions to coding theory.  Additional applications of semidefinite programming, potentially covering areas such as association schemes, extremal combinatorics, and topological graph theory, may be discussed depending on time and student interest.    Course Outline  Linear programming is a fundamental tool in optimization and discrete mathematics, with numerous applications. Linear programs are efficiently solvable and possess a rich duality theory. A central strategy in combinatorial optimization is to formulate problems as integer linear programs, then relax the integrality constraints to obtain linear programs that are easier to solve.  Linear programs are a subset of convex optimization problems. Semidefinite programming (SDP) extends linear programming to a broader class of convex programs, retaining many of the desirable properties of LPs while often providing tighter approximations. SDP methods have achieved groundbreaking results in combinatorial optimization, such as Lovász’s work on Shannon capacity and the Goemans–Williamson 0.878-approximation algorithm for Max-Cut.  This course provides an introduction to linear and semidefinite programming methods and their applications in combinatorial optimization.  The course will be organized around the following main topics:     Linear Programming and the Simplex Method: We will cover the foundations of linear programming, including duality theory, Bland’s rule, simplex tableaux, and basic computational implementations.     Graph Theory and Graph Invariants: This includes fundamental definitions, graph representations, an introduction to spectral graph theory, strongly regular graphs, and classical graph invariants (e.g., chromatic number, independence number) along with their fractional relaxations and how these can be analyzed using LP techniques.     Association Schemes and Coding Theory: Topics include the algebraic structure of association schemes, with a focus on Hamming and Johnson schemes, leading to Delsarte’s Linear Programming bound. These tools will illuminate connections between algebra, graph theory, and optimization in addressing extremal problems in coding and information theory.     Semidefinite Programming: If time permits, we will explore further applications of semidefinite programming in combinatorial optimization, including more advanced examples from graph theory, coding theory, and extremal combinatorics.       Prerequisites  Students are expected to have completed the following courses, or have obtained consent from the instructor:    Math 375 : Introduction to Discrete Mathematics — covering logic, sets, combinatorics, graphs, and basic proof techniques.   Math 417 or Math 517 : Introductory Real Analysis — foundational concepts of analysis including limits, continuity, and convergence.   Math 447 or Math 547 : Linear Algebra — including vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues, and matrix theory.   If you have not taken these courses but believe you have the equivalent background, please consult the instructor for approval.     Textbooks and Resources  Course notes will be provided throughout the semester. Much of this material will be written and updated as the course progresses, so please stay engaged, read carefully, work through the details, and report any typos or errors to the instructor for correction.  Much of the course content is adapted from the following texts by Bernd Gärtner and Jiří Matoušek:   Jiří Matoušek and Bernd Gärtner. Understanding and Using Linear Programming . Springer, 2007.

Lecture notes by Monique Laurent and Frank Vallentin (updated version available on the D2L site).    Lecture notes by Ryan O’Donnell:     Lecture notes by Bill Martin:        Course Assessments   Assessments in Math 605 will consist of two in-person exams (a midterm and final, worth 15% each), a computer project (15%), and a final reflective report based on your semester-long journal (55%).  Problem sets will be posted every few weeks but will not be collected or graded. You are expected to work collaboratively, seek help when needed, and evaluate your own understanding of the material.    Exams  There will be both a midterm and a final exam. The midterm will be announced at least one week in advance, along with a short list of topics to guide your preparation. The final exam will take place according to the University's exam schedule, during the first class period that would occur in finals week.  Each exam is worth 15% of your final course grade.    Computer Project  Midway through the semester, a computing project will be assigned either individually or in small groups of two. The project will involve reading and summarizing a relevant research paper, and implementing a linear or semidefinite programming algorithm to solve one or more problems discussed in that paper or a comparable resource.  The computer project and report is worth 15% of your final course grade.    Reflective Journal and Final Report  A significant portion of your grade (55%) will be based on a reflective report supported by a personal journal that you will maintain throughout the semester. This journal should document your ongoing engagement with the course outside of scheduled class time.  The journal should log your time spent and summarize your work on tasks such as:   Attempting and revising Learning Problem sets  Studying lecture notes and revisiting course material  Collaborating with peers in discussions or study groups  Attending office hours or scheduling additional help sessions  Emailing questions or feedback related to course content  Reading assigned or recommended references  Proofreading the course notes and offering constructive feedback  Other meaningful forms of engagement, including participation during class   At the end of the semester, you will submit a final reflective report that synthesizes insights from your journal and presents a well-reasoned argument for the grade you believe reflects your work in this part of the course. The report should critically assess your engagement, growth, and consistency, and must include selected journal excerpts to support your reflection.  While there is no fixed number of entries required, regular and thoughtful journaling is expected, in line with the university's credit hour policy (6–9 hours per week of work outside class). Your final report should go beyond a simple summary — it should demonstrate how your efforts contributed to your learning over the semester.  This ungrading model emphasizes intrinsic motivation, self-awareness, and the development of professional habits of mind. It also recognizes that meaningful learning can take many forms not easily captured through traditional assessments.      Course Grades  Final letter grades will be assigned based on the weighted averages outlined above. Specific gradelines will be drawn after all course grades are calculated based on student work in alignment with the university policy for graduate students outlined in .    "

Maverick Textbook Reserve Program  Students who cannot or do not wish to purchase a textbook for a class may be able to utilize the Maverick Textbook Reserve Program (the Essential Calculus book by James Stewart is available). The program was created to address the financial burden of textbook costs and is offered through a partnership between Student Government, the Bookstore, and the Library.  The Maverick Textbook Reserve purchases textbooks and houses them in the library for students to check out in two-hour time blocks. To see what other books are offered, you can visit the circulation desk in the library or explore the list online:   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/mssa\/services\/mavericktextbookreserve.html      Technology   Desire2Learn LMS   This class will use MNSU's online learning management system, D2L Brightspace. All course activities and communication will generally be conducted through this platform.  Information on how to use D2L Brightspace is available on the university's website:   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/it-solutions\/locations\/instructional-design-academic-technology-services\/technology-tools-for-teaching-and-learning\/d2l-brightspace\/   You can access D2L Brightspace directly at:   https:\/\/mnsu.learn.minnstate.edu\/d2l\/login      The Mathematics & Statistics Learning Center  The Mathematics & Statistics Learning Center (MLC) offers walk-in tutoring for undergraduate math and statistics courses. Staffed by Math\/Stat majors and graduate students, the center provides a welcoming environment for working with tutors or collaborating with peers on assignments.  The MLC is located in Wissink Hall 285. A schedule will be posted on D2L when it becomes available.     Center for Academic Success  In addition to offering tutoring services for students on the main floor of Memorial Library, the Center for Academic Success maintains a list of helpful online resources:   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/academics\/academic-support\/student-support-centers\/center-for-academic-success\/math-science-and-business\/resources#item-2      Accessibility Resources  Minnesota State University, Mankato provides students with disabilities reasonable accommodation to participate in educational programs, activities, or services. These include both permanent and temporary disabilities. Students requiring accommodation to engage in class activities or meet course requirements should first register with Accessibility Resources (Memorial Library 132, telephone 389-2825, TDD 711) to establish an accommodation plan.

  "title": "University Policies",
  "body": " University Policies   This section outlines university-wide policies. These policies apply to all classes at the university unless specifically stated otherwise.    Credit Hours Policy  According to university policy, each credit hour represents one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of independent student work per week, typically over a 15-week semester. This applies equally to traditional semester-long courses and to accelerated or alternative delivery formats, which must involve the same total amount of learning time.  In practical terms, this means that for a standard 3-credit course, you should plan to spend 6–9 hours per week outside of class actively engaging with course material. For a 4-credit course, the expectation rises to 8–12 hours weekly. This time includes reading, working on practice problems, completing assignments, reviewing notes, visiting office hours or other academic support systems, and preparing for exams.  Regular, distributed practice is essential for learning complex material like mathematics. Research in cognitive science consistently shows that spreading out your study time—rather than condensing it into long, infrequent sessions—leads to better long-term retention and deeper understanding. Setting aside 1–2 hours each day to review concepts and complete coursework is far more effective than a single weekly “cram session.”  Making time for consistent, focused practice is not just about keeping up with assignments—it's about training your brain to think mathematically. By returning to material frequently, you give yourself repeated opportunities to reinforce knowledge and make meaningful connections, both of which are essential for academic success.

When the activity conflicts with academic obligations, student-participants will follow a standard protocol to provide their faculty members with prior, written notification of their absences from classes. Faculty members will determine, in consultation with student participants, how missed classes and assignments are made-up in a manner that fulfills academic obligations and accommodates participatory obligations.  Except for absences resulting from sponsored or sanctioned activities, student-participants have the same responsibility in regard to class attendance and assignments as do all other students.  The full policy is available at https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/missed-classes-for-university-sponsored-or-sanctioned-activities-and-makeup-work-policy\/      University Grading Policy   A student's work in any course will be evaluated to align with the following university grade system and governing policies. Final gradelines as a percent grade may be modified to better reflect these expectations, but only in students' favor if gradelines are already provided in the individual course description.        Undergraduate Grading     University Description  Instructor's Description    A  Superior level of performance  Demonstrates mastery of course material and consistently exceeds course expectations.    B  Above-average level of performance  Shows strong understanding of course material and meets most course objectives.    C  Average level of performance  Indicates satisfactory understanding of course material and meets basic course objectives.    D  Below-average level of performance  Indicates not adequately meeting course objectives or demonstration of insufficient mastery of course material.    F  Failing level of performance  Indicates failure to meet course objectives and demonstated a significant lack of understanding of the material.         Graduate Grading     University Description  Instructor's Description    A  Superior level of performance  Demonstrates mastery of course material and consistently exceeds course expectations.    B  Above-average level of performance  Shows strong understanding of course material and meets most course objectives.    C  Below-average level of performance  Indicates satisfactory understanding of course material and meets basic course objectives.    D  Unacceptable level of performance  Indicates not adequately meeting course objectives or demonstration of insufficient mastery of course material.    F  Failing level of performance  Indicates failure to meet course objectives and demonstated a significant lack of understanding of the material.     Graduate students should be aware that while the Instructor’s Description of assignments and grading remains consistent for both undergraduate and graduate students (as indicated in the third column), the University’s Description of letter grades differs. Specifically, graduate students are held to a higher academic standard.  At the graduate level, the minimum acceptable performance is considered “above average” by university standards. This means that simply fulfilling the basic requirements of an assignment may not be sufficient for a high grade. Graduate students are expected to demonstrate a deeper, more critical understanding of course material, engage with concepts at a higher level of abstraction, and communicate their insights with clarity, precision, and intellectual rigor.  In addition, graduate-level work demands stronger metacognitive skills—such as the ability to reflect on one’s own learning, identify areas for growth, and adjust approaches accordingly. These heightened expectations align with the broader goals of graduate education: to cultivate independent thinkers, researchers, and professionals capable of contributing original ideas to their field.  While course content and assignments may overlap in cross-listed undergraduate\/graduate courses, graduate students are evaluated by more rigorous standards, particularly in terms of depth of analysis, scholarly engagement, and critical thinking.   The grade of Incomplete (I) is reserved for special cases. A student and instructor must complete and sign an Incomplete Contract that specifies the assigned grade of \"I\" for the course and outlines requirements for its completion.  The full university grading policy is available at   https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/grading\/      Grade Appeals Policy  Students have the right to ask an instructor for an explanation of any grade received. Grade appeals are reviewed in instances where students perceive that a final course grade is unfair , arbitrary , or capricious . Students must begin the procedures of this policy within two weeks* of university notification of a final course grade.   *The time period consists of normal university operating days when classes are held. Under unusual circumstances, deadlines may be extended. If the University representative, at any step, fails to review and\/or respond within the time limits provided, the student may proceed to the next step. If the student fails to respond within the time limits provided, the appeal shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.   Students should retain copies of all materials associated with this process for their records. Students should also have records of their coursework from the class as part of the appeal process and be able to clearly explain why they believe their letter grade assignment does not align with university grading policies as outlined in .  The full policy is available at https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/grade-appeals\/ .     Academic Honesty Policy  As members of the university community, students are expected to fulfill their academic responsibilities with integrity and honesty. This includes avoiding misconduct such as plagiarism, cheating, or collusion. Violations of academic honesty may result in both academic consequences (such as a lowered grade or failing the course) and disciplinary actions (such as probation, suspension, or expulsion).  The full policy, including official definitions of plagiarism, cheating, and collusion, can be found at:   https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/academic-honesty\/      Electronic Recording of Lectures   This policy exists to protect the use of copyrighted materials included in this course. Recording, sharing, or distributing course content without explicit permission may violate copyright laws. Such actions can result in disciplinary measures by the university and may also carry legal consequences. Additionally, uploading course materials to websites such as Chegg without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited and constitutes a copyright violation.   Students are not permitted to record lectures or make electronic copies of course materials (e.g., slides, formulas, lecture notes) using personal recording devices (e.g., smart phone, tablet, computer, digital recorder) unless prior written permission from faculty is obtained and students who appear in the recordings or course materials do not object. The policy applies to all forms of course delivery (e.g., on-campus, online).  Student attendance in a FlexSync course implies student consent to be recorded.  Permission is limited to a student’s educational use during a course. Recordings and materials must be destroyed at the end of each term. Students who do not destroy recordings and materials may be subject to disciplinary action.  Unauthorized downloading, file sharing, distribution of all or part of a recorded lecture or course materials or using information for purposes other than the student's own learning may be deemed a violation of this policy and subject to disciplinary action.  ADA Accomodations  In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), students may record and retain classroom lectures and instructional materials as part of an approved accommodation plan coordinated by the Office of Accessibility Resources in consultation with the student and faculty. However, as stated elsewhere in this policy, recorded lectures or copied materials must be destroyed at the end of each term.  The full policy is available at https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/electronic-recording-of-lectures-and-materials\/ .    "

BitMoji made a version which includes a cartoon avatar of your instructor.      I'm Dr. Hollingsworth (call me Dr. !), and I am a new(ish) Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics within Minnesota State University, Mankato. I grew up in the Ozark Mountains in North Central Arkansas, and I spent a lot of time outdoors hiking, bicycling, and hammock camping. I don't get a lot of time for hiking or camping these days, but I still commute to campus by bicycle or electric kick-scooter almost every day.  I started homeschooling after sixth grade, with almost no math curriculum. Consequently, I didn't really start learning mathematics until I started at the community college when I was 25.    Before that, I spent 6 years as a (self-taught) computer programmer working primarily on transportation and logistics software for line haul trucking companies, followed by 2 years as a freelance photographer (My favorite CV line item from this time is being published in a magazine titled Blood & Thunder !). At school, I started as a business major with a minor in studio art, and the major quickly changed to mathematics. I eventually transfered and graduated from the University of Central Arkansas with a BA in Mathematics and a minor in studio art (mostly printmaking and ceramics). After taking a year off to teach at a community college, I went to the University of Delaware for my Master's and Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics, writing my dissertation on the underlying mathematical framework for high-dimensional signal processing and studying constructions of such schemes. Now, I spend a lot of time crafting materials for the courses I teach (like this one!) and do my best to help students succeed.  I have lived in North Mankato for three years now with my partner and our dog Gemma. We all enjoy cooking (well, Gemma enjoys eating), reading, and bicycling. We enjoy good coffee (we use an Aeropress or Flair) and I enjoy cleaning, although neither of the other two do. Most of my free time\/weekends are spent on home-improvement projects. This summer, we travelled to Scotland and also finally unpacked from our last move.   On campus, I am teaching two sections of MATH122 Calculus II and one section of MATH605 Graphs and Algorithms. I am also  running a math playground at the Children's Museum of Southern Minnesota, writing a book on Algebraic Combinatorics and Optimization, and mentoring through the National Math Stars program. I stay busy!  You can follow my dog Gemma's personal adventures on her Instagram (@GemmaIsAGoodGirl), which just shows you that my dog is better at social media than I am. However, you can find me online through my website (woefully in need of updating, I plan on moving it to GitHub pages eventually) at sites.google.com\/view\/math-kgh .  "
