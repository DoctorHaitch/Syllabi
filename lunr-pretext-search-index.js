  "title": "Welcome to the Course",
  "body": " Welcome to the Course    I want you to succeed in this class! As your professor, I am committed to creating an equitable learning environment where all students feel they belong and are supported. While mathematics is often perceived as objective and culture-free, mathematics education is deeply shaped by the cultural context in which it occurs.  In this section of the syllabus, we will explore how identity, inclusion, and pedagogy intersect—and how these elements impact your experience as a student of mathematics.    Equity and Inclusion  Our experiences outside of mathematics classrooms shape how we experience learning within them. Research has shown that students' sense of belonging in a math class significantly influences their learning outcomes. When students feel isolated or marginalized, their cognitive resources are diverted—often toward worries about how they are perceived, or managing the emotional toll of microaggressions.  For example, a student may spend energy wondering whether their classmates or instructor will judge them harshly for a mistake, or struggling internally with a racist, sexist, classist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist comment. These challenges interfere with learning and diminish the joy and discovery that mathematics can offer.  Mathematician William Yslas Vélez once wrote, \"If a student finds pleasure and joy in finding a solution, in understanding a new concept, then this emotion is a sign of belonging to the mathematical community\" ( Imposter Syndrome , AMS e-Mentoring Network, 1\/25\/2019). While frustration and struggle are natural parts of learning math, I strive to create an environment where all students have opportunities to experience joy, discovery, and belonging through mathematical thinking.    Student Diversity  The diversity of our class is a valuable resource. Different backgrounds bring a wide range of problem-solving approaches, creative ideas, and insights. After years of teaching, I continue to be surprised and inspired by the questions and perspectives that students bring to our shared learning.  This classroom is a space where all individuals will be treated with dignity and respect. I welcome students of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, and abilities—including both visible and nonvisible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, inclusive, and welcoming learning environment.    Commitment to Anti-Racist Pedagogy   (Adapted from “White Supremacy Culture Still Here” by Tema Okun)   The concept of white supremacy refers to how dominant power structures in the U.S. used pseudo-scientific ideas of race to create hierarchies of value—dividing people by race, class, and culture in ways that serve those in power. These systems of disconnection not only separate people from each other but also from the natural world and even from themselves. These power structures seek to   divide white people from Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC);  divide BIPOC communities from each other;  divide white people from other white people;  disconnect all of us from the natural world and non-human life; and  disconnect each person from their own sense of self and possibility.   In my courses, we commit to dismantling these harmful systems by practicing the following:   Admitting when we are wrong, understanding that vulnerability is a strength—especially for those with privilege or power.  Recognizing that discomfort is a catalyst for growth and learning.  Learning to sit with discomfort before reacting.  Not taking everything personally—we all bring flaws and gifts to our shared learning.  Creating a culture where it is safe to raise problems and challenges.  Questioning norms about what is the \"right way\" and rethinking the meaning of \"mistakes\".  Valuing multiple ways of knowing, and understanding ourselves as contributors to an evolving collective understanding.  Receiving feedback with openness—whether it is skillful or unskillful and either way, it will not kill you.  Recognizing defensiveness as rooted in fear and privilege; examining what we are protecting and why.  Being willing to deviate from the agenda to address real human concerns, knowing that long-term learning benefits from this responsiveness.     Preferred Name and Pronouns  I will gladly honor your request to be addressed by your preferred name or pronouns. Please inform me early in the semester so I can update my records accordingly and respect your identity throughout the course.   "

  "title": "General Course Policies",
  "body": " General Course Policies   This section provides policies and advice on how to best use them which apply to every course I teach.    Course Feedback and Grade Tracking  Feedback is an essential component of the learning process in this course. Marked assignments are typically returned during regular class meetings. If you are absent on a day when feedback is distributed—usually when the next graded assessment is returned—you will need to either wait until the following distribution day or visit the instructor during office hours to collect your graded work.  Grades will be recorded directly on your returned assignments and may or may not be posted to D2L. You are responsible for tracking your own progress throughout the semester. Keeping a personal record of your scores will help you stay informed, monitor your performance, and make strategic decisions about your study habits.  As students in a mathematics course, you are expected to be able to calculate your own course grade using the weight structure provided in the course syllabus. In most of the instructor’s courses, exam grades are weighted using a flexible structure: your highest exam score receives the greatest weight, and your lowest exam score the least. This policy is intended to reflect that all course material is important, while also recognizing that students may have an off day. The goal is to reward consistent performance and reduce the impact of a single poor test result. Because most online gradebooks do not support this type of weighting, your final grade cannot be automatically calculated in the course Learning Management System.  If you have questions about how to interpret feedback, calculate your course grade, or improve your performance based on instructor comments, you are strongly encouraged to attend office hours or reach out via email. Making use of feedback is a key part of your success in this course.     Effective Use of Office Hours  Office hours are one of the most valuable resources available to you in any of your courses. They are dedicated times when you can meet with your instructor to ask questions, clarify concepts, and receive individualized support. You are strongly encouraged to take advantage of them, whether you're struggling, curious, or simply want to stay on track. Here are some effective ways to use office hours:    Get help with homework or assigned problems: Bring questions about specific problems you've attempted and want help understanding or solving.    Clarify difficult concepts from class: If something from lecture didn’t fully make sense, office hours are a great time to revisit and reinforce those ideas.    Explore how topics connect across courses: Discuss how the current material relates to what you’ve learned in previous math classes or how it might apply in future courses or real-world contexts.    Get advice on effective study strategies: Learn how to take better notes, manage time, approach problem sets, and prepare for exams in a way that suits this course’s structure.    Ask about academic or career pathways: Whether you're considering a math major, teaching certification, or a STEM-related field, office hours are a chance to get informed advice.    Review feedback from graded assignments: Discuss mistakes you made and ask questions about how to improve or approach similar problems differently in the future.    Build rapport with your instructor: Forming a professional relationship can help you feel more comfortable asking questions and may lead to future opportunities like recommendation letters or research experiences.    You do not need to have a specific question prepared to attend office hours—sometimes simply talking through material aloud with your instructor can help clarify your thinking. Feel free to request a joint appointment with one or two classmates if you're working through the same material.  Office hours for this course are available primarily by appointment to allow for flexibility and to make the best use of the instructor's time across teaching, grading, student communication, and other university responsibilities. This model also helps ensure that the instructor meets the university’s 10-hour weekly student availability requirement in a sustainable and effective way.  Appointments can be scheduled online using the following link: http:\/\/link.mnsu.edu\/drh-oh . You may schedule individually or as a small group if you'd prefer to review material collaboratively.  If you happen to see the instructor's office door open, you are welcome to check in and ask if now is a good time for questions. However, please be aware that the instructor may be busy with other responsibilities, and students with scheduled appointments will be given priority.     Late Work and Missed Assessments   Missed Assignments: Assignments in this course are intentionally designed to help you prepare for upcoming assessments and to deepen your understanding of key concepts. To ensure fairness and maintain academic integrity, solutions or feedback are often shared on or shortly after the original due date. For this reason, late submissions will not be accepted for any assignment once solutions have been released, the relevant assessment has taken place, or graded work has been returned.  If you are unable to attend class on the day an assignment is due, you may email a digital copy to the instructor before class begins to timestamp your submission. The physical copy should then be submitted at the next class meeting.  Because late submissions create additional grading and administrative overhead, they are subject to a cumulative penalty: the first late assignment will be accepted at full credit; the second will receive a 25% deduction; the third, a 50% deduction; and the fourth and all subsequent late submissions will receive no credit. Additionally, late work will be placed at the bottom of the grading queue. While every effort will be made to provide feedback, timely grading is not guaranteed, and in rare cases, late work may not be graded until the week of final exams.  Submitting work on time is essential for staying on track with the course and for benefiting fully from instructor feedback. Meeting deadlines ensures that material is completed while it is still relevant and that you are well-prepared for future assessments. Delays often result in missed opportunities for reflection, clarification, and academic growth.  Students are expected to manage their time responsibly and communicate proactively. If you anticipate a conflict or difficulty meeting a deadline due to extenuating circumstances, you must contact the instructor in advance to discuss possible accommodations. Requests made after a deadline will generally not be considered unless otherwise stated in an individual assignment or course policy.  An exception to this policy applies to University-Sanctioned Events, as described in . In such cases, students must communicate in advance to make arrangements for meeting assignment deadlines or completing alternate work.   Missed Exams: Exams may be made up only during the same calendar week as the university’s final exam period. No other make-up opportunities will be offered. Shorter assessments may be eligible for make-up during office hours or through department provided proctoring at the instructor’s discretion.  To request a make-up, students must email the instructor as soon as possible after missing the scheduled assessment. No documentation is required or expected—timely communication is sufficient.  This policy ensures consistency and fairness while accommodating occasional, unavoidable conflicts. Consolidating make-ups into the final exam week helps maintain instructional continuity and supports efficient grading throughout the semester.     Comments on AI usage and Academic Integrity   Artificial Intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly accessible and capable of producing work that may superficially resemble student-generated submissions. As your instructor, I want to address this honestly: many students across higher education—and perhaps even in my courses—are using AI to complete their assignments. While this may feel like a convenient solution in the short term, I encourage you to consider the deeper and longer-term consequences of that choice.  Submitting work generated by AI without critical engagement is not just a matter of academic dishonesty—it is a missed opportunity to grow intellectually and develop as a thinker. The university currently offers limited tools for detecting or enforcing restrictions on AI-generated content, which means that at times I may grade work that I strongly suspect was not created by the student. This creates a difficult ethical space. My primary goal is not to act as a surveillance system, but to support your development as an educated and capable person.  Your education is more than a checklist of assignments and grades. It is an investment in the most valuable asset you will carry throughout your life: your mind. Relying on external tools to bypass the struggle of learning can leave you with credentials but without competence. The consequences of this are significant. Without the ability to think critically, evaluate evidence, question assumptions, and communicate persuasively, you may find yourself unprepared to navigate complex professional, civic, and personal challenges.  An uneducated mind is easily manipulated, unable to discern nuance, and limited in perspective. In contrast, an educated mind enriches every aspect of life. It allows you to live more fully, to appreciate complexity, to contribute meaningfully to your community, and to face the world with confidence and clarity. These are not abstract ideals—they are practical, lifelong advantages.  Regular practice, intellectual struggle, and reflection are how learning happens. These are the habits of mind that education is designed to instill. When you skip those steps, you don't just cheat the system—you cheat yourself of becoming the person you could be.  This does not mean AI has no place in your education. When used ethically and thoughtfully—as a supplement rather than a substitute—it can enhance your learning. Translation tools, research assistance, and data analysis applications can be valuable resources. But using AI to do your thinking, writing, or problem-solving for you turns a powerful tool into a crutch. In those moments, you are robbing yourself of growth.  Generations before you have fought for the privilege of education. It is not too late to honor their sacrifices—and your own potential—by choosing to engage fully, honestly, and bravely with your education. This class is your opportunity to learn how to think for yourself. If you don't take that opportunity now, someone—or something—else will be thinking for you for the rest of your life.  Let’s use the tools of the present to build a stronger future—one rooted in integrity, critical thinking, and a commitment to lifelong learning.    "

  "title": "MATH122 - Calculus 2",
  "body": " MATH122 - Calculus 2   This course builds on your foundation in calculus by introducing advanced integration techniques, applications of integration, improper integrals, numerical methods, calculus of parametric curves, and infinite sequences and series. These topics are core analytical tools used throughout science, engineering, and applied mathematics.  If some of this terminology is unfamiliar, that’s expected, you're taking this course to start learning these concepts! The first section below outlines the kinds of problems and questions these concepts help us address—from modeling physical systems to analyzing complex data. By the end of the course, you’ll have a basic understanding of how calculus might help with rigorous problem-solving in STEM fields.  In addition to mastering these new topics, you’ll continue to reinforce fluency with essential skills from arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and Calculus I. These fundamentals remain critical across the sciences for precisely quantifying and interpreting relationships in real-world systems.    Course Outline  A planned schedule for the semester is provided at the end of this document. This second semester course will cover Chapters 6 through 9 of the textbook officially adopted by our department as described in , although almost any modern Calculus textbook will serve for this section of the course. Please see it for important dates such as quizzes and exams .  Roughly, our semester is organized to study the following questions (in order):  How can the relationships between integrals and derivatives help us model real-world phenomena? In general, how can integration help us calculate useful quantities? (Sections xx)  What can we do when the anti-derivative is not obvious? (Sections xx)  How do we work with curves that are not functions or perform Calculus in other coordinate systems? (Sections xx)  How do we deal with quantities involving infinity that still result in finite answers? (Sections xx)  Finally, when our techniques from answering (2) fail (or are impossible), can we still find meaningful answers to Calculus questions? If so, how? (Sections xx)       Why study calculus?  This rigorous mathematical subject consists of a basic mathematical tool kit for dealing with processes that change continuously. Part of the reason that calculus turns out to be so useful is that the details of the process turn out not to matter so much -- all that matters is that the process is continuous. In fact, if the increments are small enough, discrete processes can sometimes be approximated as continuous and treated using the techniques of calculus. More specifically, Calculus is the story of infinitely improving approximations concerned with two historical problems:  The slope of a \"curvy line\" at a point.  The area beneath a \"curvy line\".  Miraculously, these two problems, which may seem barely related except for the type of line they seek to study, turn out to be deeply intertwined. This semester, we will primarily focus on the second problem, but due to the dual nature of these problems the other is necessary and a skill which you hopefully developed during Calculus I.  In order to do well in MATH122 , you need to work on developing both conceptual understanding and algebraic fluency. Conceptual understanding is necessary as memorized facts are not much help if you do not know how to use them. Algebraic fluency is required as knowing the basic concepts is not very helpful if you are unable to easily use them because your knowledge is not built on a firm foundation of the governing principles.  By fluency, I mean that you can generally use them without thinking about them. Fluency is defined as the ability to speak or write a language easily and accurately . Similar to your fluency in your native language, where you likely are fluent in 10000-20000 words, you are expected to be fluent in a number of \"mathematical rules\" which you have learned over the last several years. Note, there is a full inventory of the algebraic, trigonometric, and Calculus I skills with which you need to be fluent in (TODO:INSERT REFERENCE HERE ONCE IT IS PORTED TO PRETEXT).     Prequisites  Formally, being enrolled in MATH122 requires having passed MATH121 with a 'C' or better, or explicit consent of the instructor. Any student being found not to meet these requirements will automatically receive a failing grade at the end of the semester.  In practice, Calculus II depends heavily on algebra , analytic geometry , trigonometry and your knowledge from Calculus I . Several review worksheets are posted on D2L Brightspace to help you recall the knowledge that will help you succeed in Calculus II this semester. A list of specific material that will be used to scaffold new knowledge can be found in the Expected Prior Knowledge section. (TODO:Reference to Expected Knowledge Section).     Learning Outcomes  Upon completion of this course students will have demonstrated  a working knowledge of Riemann integration theory and several specific applications. This will build off material from MATH121: Calculus I .  a working knowledge of sequences, series, and their relevance to calculus.  their ability to memorize, derive, and practice facts (the derivatives and antiderivatives of basic functions, for instance) and fundamental theorems.  understanding what is going on behind the symbols by developing the patterns of thought and the problem-solving skills needed when dealing with problems involving continuous change and difficult integrals. If you limit yourself to memorizing facts and formulas, you will miss out on this very important part of the course, which makes calculus so important for so many application areas.  team work skills by collaborating within a small group, towards completion of a common task or goal.    TODO: Revise these and align some with The Ohio State Calculus Learning Outcomes     Course Delivery  Sessions will be in person. Many classes will require you to complete a 'pre-class assignment' to be turned in at the start of class. Lectures will be interactive and often be interrupted or replaced by individual or small group practice. You are expected to participate in class. If you are having trouble understanding anything please feel free to raise your hand and ask about it, or discuss it with your peers during the group work times. If you are not comfortable doing this, please email me, visit my drop-in practice hours, schedule an appointment during office hours, or ask immediately after class.     MavPASS  MavPASS (Peer-Facilitated Academic Support System): This semester, we are offering additional support to help students to succeed in this course. Students who have taken this class in a previous semester have been hired as MavPASS Leaders to sit in on the course with you, facilitate study sessions outside of class, and hold office hours.  Your MavPASS leader this semester is Caleb Pardeik , a student in the Computer Engineering program. Your MavPASS schedule for this semester is    Day  Time  Event  Location    Monday  10:00AM-10:50AM  MP Working Session  WH283    Wednesday  4:00PM-4:50PM  MP Working Session  WH286A    Tuesday  2:00PM-3:00PM  Office Hour  Zoom    Wednesday  1:00PM-2:00PM  Office Hour  Zoom    Note, the two Working Sessions cover the same material, so you may attend whichever is more convenient for your schedule (you do not need to attend both). You can also find the schedule at www.mnsu.edu\/mavpass . For additional information, please email mavpass@mnsu.edu .     Subsequent Courses and Programs  To give a sense of the scale, scope, and importance of Calculus II, this is the current list of courses which require Calculus II with a 'C' or better as an entry requirement. Note, for Computer Science, many of your classes list MATH247: Linear Algebra , which is dependent on Calculus II. This is likely true for other programs as well, and I'd like to get a similar list for MATH247 in the near future.         Course  Title  Course  Title    AST225  Astronomy\/Astrophysics II  MATH290  Foundations of Mathematics    CHEM101  General Chem Skills  MATH321  Ordinary Differential Equations    CHEM190  Learning in Chem Applic  STAT354  Concepts of Prob & Stats    CHEM191  Chemistry Applications  MATH461  Mathematical Theory of Interest    CHEM446  Physical Chemistry II  MATH570  Numerical Analysis I    ME281  Computing Techniques  MATH528  Linear Optimization    ME291  Engineering Analysis  PHYS335  Modern Physics I    ENGR240  Linear Circuits  PHYS457  Optics    MATH223  Calculus III  PHYS565  Computer Applicat Phys    MATH247  Linear Algebra I       Additionally, Calculus II is listed required by the following degree programs as a course or major prerequisite or Major Common Core requirement:     Program  Program    Automotive Engineering Technology (BS)  Manufacturing Eng. Technology (BS)    Biochemistry (BS)  Mathematics (BA\/BS)    Chemistry - ACS Approved (BS)  Mathematics Teaching (BS)    Civil Engineering (BSCE)  Mechanical Engineering (BSME)    Computer Engineering (BSEC)  Physics (BS)    Computer Science (BS)  Software Engineering (BS)    Electrical Engineering (BSEE)  Statistics (BS)    Integrated Engineering (BSE)  Statistics (BS) Actuarial Track     Finally, the degree programs for Biotechnology (BS) and Economics (BA\/BS) strongly recommend Calculus II for any students planning to pursue graduate or professional school.     Suggested Textbooks  The textbook officially adopted by the department for this course is:     Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals by James Stewart, edition.     ISBN : 978-1133112280    However, since the required practice will be assigned directly to you, almost any Calculus textbook will suffice. This includes any edition of Stewart’s texts, freely available Open Educational Resource (OER) options from sites like OpenStax, and others. The most important consideration is the order of topics. For example, Stewart’s textbooks typically present advanced integration techniques before the applications of integration, while this course takes the reverse approach—motivating techniques through early applications.  A textbook that follows a similar order to this course is Calculus by Larson and Edwards (currently in its 12th edition, though any edition will work). Students looking for an affordable physical textbook might consider an older edition of Larson and Edwards.  Another strong and inexpensive alternative closely aligned with the departmental textbook is:     APEX Calculus by Gregory Hartman.     ISBN : 978-1719263382    This book is freely available online and as a downloadable PDF. Print copies can typically be purchased for $15–$20 via Amazon. We will primarily cover content from Calculus 2, with a few sections drawn from Calculus 3. If you prefer a printed textbook, APEX Calculus Volume 2 is likely sufficient; the few Calculus 3 topics we cover can be accessed digitally.   Please be aware, that if you continue into Calculus 3, you may still be required to purchase the current edition of Stewart's Calculus to obtain access to the digital homework system used by other instructors. These alternatives are provided in this section as a low-cost alternative to Stewart's Calculus.      Earned Letter Grades   You will earn the following letter grade based on the calculation of your weighted course average based on your demonstration of course learning objections through course assessments.           Letter Grade  Weighted Average  Letter Grade  Weighted Average  Letter Grade  Weighted Average    A  [92,100]  B-  [77,80)  D  [62,65)    A-  [88,92)  C+  [74,77)  D-  [59,62)    B+  [84,88)  C  [70,74)  F  [0,59)    B  [80,84)  D+  [65,70)      For a general interpretation of grade letters and how they are designed to reflect your understanding of the material and preparedness for future courses, see .     Course Assessments   The letter grade you earn in the course determined by your demonstration of course outcomes through the following assessment types. The weighted percentage in measuring demonstration of course outcomes is also provided. A description of each assessment is provided below the weights table.       Assessment  Weight  Description    Foundations Quiz (Q00)  5%  In class quiz testing memorized facts and their applications in Calculus I.    Group Participation  5%  In class groupwork completion and participation.    Preclass Assignments  10%  Short assignments used to assess student's mathematical writing, review of required knowledge, and exploration of course competencies and interconnections.    Required Practice Journal  10%  Homework journal for computations and conceptual practice of course competencies. Problem sets are posted on D2L.    Quizzes (5)  20%  Short assessments to check progress between exams. Lowest mark dropped from gradebook.    Exams (3)  40%  (17%-13%-10%) Chapter exams will be based on material from the Required Practice problem sets, Preclass Assignments, in-class Groupwork activities, Quizzes, and the Exam Practice Problem sets. To be successful, make sure you're consistently engaging with these resources and setting aside regular time each day to practice. Last-minute cramming is not an effective strategy for this course.    Final Project  10%  See description below.    Final Exam  ---  Optional. Will be used to replace a prior exam score.     In general, I am not primarily interested in your final answers—I am far more concerned with your ability to clearly demonstrate an understanding of the process that leads to those answers. This emphasis on process is intentional: it reflects the reality that in real-world problem solving, especially in STEM fields, knowing how to arrive at a correct solution is just as important—if not more so—than the solution itself. For this reason, I provide final answers for most out-of-class practice problem sets, so you can focus your effort on understanding the steps that lead to those solutions.  On quizzes and exams, partial credit will be minimal unless you include clear, valid, and logical supporting work. I want to see how you reason through a problem, not just whether you can arrive at the right number.  Additionally, while not all techniques we study in this course will be equally relevant to every student—given the diverse majors represented in Calculus II—the foundational mathematical skills you develop will remain relevant in all future STEM courses. Demonstrating fluency with these core skills—such as algebraic manipulation, mathematical reasoning, and structured problem-solving—not only reinforces your conceptual understanding now but also builds a toolkit you’ll continue to rely on as problems become more complex and domain-specific.  Ultimately, my goal is to help you build both confidence and competence in your problem-solving process, which is a transferable skill across all scientific and technical disciplines.    Foundations Quiz (Q00)  Write a brief description of the content of Quiz 0, and where resources to study for it may be found. (This will be based on the revised Quiz02 from Spring 2025).    Group Participation  Write a brief description of this assessment type.    Preclass Assignments  Write a brief description of this assessment type.    Required Practice Journal  Write a brief description of this assessment type.    Quizzes  Write a brief description of this assessment type.    Exams  About one week prior to each chapter exam, a practice problem set will be posted. These sets will include approximately 80 problems, some of which will appear directly on the exam. If you have been consistently completing the required practice problem sets, this packet will serve as effective review and reinforcement.  However, if you have not completed the ongoing practice, it is not realistic to expect that you can work through the entire problem set in the time available. Instead, use it strategically: scan through the problems to identify content areas where you feel uncertain or cannot immediately determine how to begin. If you find yourself unable to sketch out a general solution process for a problem, that topic likely needs further review.  To reinforce these areas, you are encouraged to bring questions from the packet to academic support resources such as MavPASS sessions, the Math and Statistics Learning Center, office hours, or the Center for Academic Success. For more information on these resources, see .  Exams will be completed in class and will follow a traditional format. Approximately 50% of each exam will consist of problems taken directly from the study packet. The remaining questions will be drawn from or modeled on problems from the Required Practice problem sets, Preclass Assignments, Groupwork Assignments, and Quizzes.    Exam Revisions  Students who are meeting course expectations will have the opportunity to earn back partial credit by submitting written reflections and corrected solutions after receiving a graded exam. This revision process is designed to reinforce understanding and promote deeper learning, as well as allowing students to learn from their mistakes.  To be eligible for exam revision credit, students must meet at least one of the following requirements:    Maintain an average class attendance of at least 85% .    Maintain a Required Practice Journal in which every section is present and at least 70% complete.    Attend a MavPASS session for each Required Practice problem set that is below 70% completion.    As your instructor, I fully expect you to make mistakes—that’s part of the learning process. However, it remains essential that you approach each exam with serious preparation and genuine effort. Revisions are not a substitute for studying; they are a structured opportunity to reflect on your performance, identify patterns in your understanding, and strengthen the academic habits that support long-term success.  The revision process is designed to help you engage more deeply with the material and to develop critical skills such as self-assessment, persistence, and metacognitive awareness. If one or more exams do not go as planned, revisions allow you to recover some credit while learning how to better prepare for future assessments.  That said, revisions should not be viewed as a fallback or safety net. Students who rely on revisions instead of putting forth their best effort from the outset often fall behind in the course and struggle to catch up. Use revisions as a learning tool—not a crutch. The goal is not just to improve your grade, but to grow as an independent and resilient learner.    Final Project  Write a brief description of this assessment type.    Final Exam  Write a brief description of this assessment type.      Prerequisite Knowledge for Calculus II   This document was originally created in Fall 2023 and will be updated as needed. If you have suggestions or feedback, I’d be glad to hear from you—your input is always welcome!  The purpose of this list is not to teach you the concepts from scratch. Rather, it serves as a comprehensive reminder of the topics you’ve already studied and will need to use fluently in Calculus II. Your textbook, online resources, and other references will likely assume you know these topics, which means they often won’t be explicitly explained in problems or solutions—even those found online. This list provides the names and brief descriptions of key concepts to help you identify any gaps in your understanding. It is your responsibility to ensure you're prepared to apply them whenever they arise, both in this course and beyond.  What follows is a curated list of foundational topics that students often need in order to succeed in Calculus II. For each, I’ve noted where you likely first encountered it, though you've probably seen them multiple times since. This goes well beyond the general prerequisite of \"Completed Calculus I with a C or better.\" These are the specific pieces of knowledge you'll be expected to build upon. Struggling with these concepts is a common reason students find Calculus II challenging. You've invested many years into learning mathematics up to this point—you’re now expected to master and apply these ideas fluently. Math is the language of many sciences, and these foundational concepts remain critical well beyond this course.     Arithmetic   How to add, subtract, multiply, and divide  The basic rules: distribution, commutativity, transitivity (especially of equality and inequalities)  How to do all of the above with fractions  How to get a common denominator  How to simplify complex fractions  How to multiply quickly by \"skip counting\"  The division algorithm (Yes, long division)     Algebra   Understand the difference between a mathematical function and a mathematical expression  How to find the distance between two points on a number line  How to solve for unknowns, regardless of the symbol representing it  How to solve rational and root functions (and know what extraneous solutions are)   How to solve systems of equations for multiple unknowns  Method of Elimination or Substitution (both work, choose your favorite, knowing both is even better)      How to determine the equation of a line  Equations of Horizontal and Vertical lines  Point-slope, slope-intercept, and two-point forms      The graphs of basic polynomial functions and nth root functions, and how composition with linear functions affect them.  The relationship between algebraic and visual (graph) representations, and the definition of the Cartesian plane.  Domains and ranges of common functions, and how these are related to the domains and ranges of inverses      How to factor a polynomial equation (knowing multiple methods is a plus!)   General Strategies  Factor by grouping  Guess and test factoring (and knowing how to quickly verify that something is a factor)  Do not rely on graphs, they can be misleading.      Special Strategies for Quadratics  Sum\/product method  Quadratic formula  Discriminant and root classification  Related: Recognizing irreducible factors quickly  Perfect square and difference of squares formulas (there are also formulas for cubics, but these appear less frequently--but not never!)  Completing the square  Also, if you want to study classical physics, Newton literally wrote a book called \"Conic Sections\" -- because they are that important -- and completely the square is a fundamental calculation for understanding them.        Advanced Strategies  Descartes' Rule of Signs and the Rational Root Theorem  Synthetic division, and understanding that it is just shorthand for long division        How to add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions   Understand equality of functions ( means what, precisely?)  Specifically, when polynomial functions are equal and conclusions we can make about them as a result.      Rules of exponents  And how they relate to logarithmic rules     The division algorithm for polynomials (long division... again!)   The absolute value function  In both piecewise and radical form  As with all other fundamental functions, understand its graph and geometric meaning  The intuitive interpretation of the absolute value of differences     Even and Odd functions, the definitions and how to determine if a function is even, odd, or neither   Graphs of rational functions  Types of asymptotes and discontinuities, and how to identify them all and determine their behaviors        Trigonometry    Graphs of trig functions and transformations (translations and dilations)  (and their inverses)      The unit triangle. Instead of memorizing, learn to construct it from minimal knowledge such as  SOHCAHTOA and ASTC  Using special triangles to evaluate trig functions at common angles     Coordinates on the unit circle using and   Common trig identities  Reciprocal  Even\/Odd  Pythagorean  Sum of angles for and        Calculus I   Definition of a limit and strategies to computing them   Definition of derivative (formally, as a limit) and its geometric meaning  Equation of a tangent line  First and second derivative tests and how they relate to curve sketching      Derivative rules, and the derivatives of all basic functions.  Constant, sum\/difference, product, quotient (and how to derive it from product), and chain rules  Derivatives of polynomials, trig, and exponential functions. The derivatives of the inverse of each of these.   Implicit differentiation  Example : find of or if is also a function of , calculate if .       Antiderivatives.  All the antiderivatives obtained from differentiation of common functions  Memorize antiderivatives of and (although you will learn to calculate them this semester)  Calculation through algebraic manipulation  -Substitution (and which derivative rule it is related to)  Why \" \" appears in indefinite integrals -- and just as importantly why it does not in definite integrals      Definition of the definite integral as a Riemann sum limit  Compute left, right, and midpoint approximations      Exponential and logarithmic equations  Graphs and transformations  Solving and simplifying      Fundamental Theorem of Calculus   You don't need to know the proof, but you should appreciate the reason Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem is the key idea that makes this magnificent theorem work.

  "body": " Student Learning Resources   This section outlines university-wide resources. These resources are available to all students to support them in their educational journey.    Maverick Textbook Reserve Program  Students who cannot or do not wish to purchase a textbook for a class may be able to utilize the Maverick Textbook Reserve Program (the Essential Calculus book by James Stewart is available). The program was created to address the financial burden of textbook costs and is offered through a partnership between Student Government, the Bookstore, and the Library.  The Maverick Textbook Reserve purchases textbooks and houses them in the library for students to check out in two-hour time blocks. To see what other books are offered, you can visit the circulation desk in the library or explore the list online:   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/mssa\/services\/mavericktextbookreserve.html      Technology   Desire2Learn LMS   This class will use MNSU's online learning management system, D2L Brightspace. All course activities and communication will generally be conducted through this platform.  Information on how to use D2L Brightspace is available on the university's website:   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/it-solutions\/locations\/instructional-design-academic-technology-services\/technology-tools-for-teaching-and-learning\/d2l-brightspace\/   You can access D2L Brightspace directly at:   https:\/\/mnsu.learn.minnstate.edu\/d2l\/login      The Mathematics & Statistics Learning Center  The Mathematics & Statistics Learning Center (MLC) offers walk-in tutoring for undergraduate math and statistics courses. Staffed by Math\/Stat majors and graduate students, the center provides a welcoming environment for working with tutors or collaborating with peers on assignments.  The MLC is located in Wissink Hall 285. A schedule will be posted on D2L when it becomes available.     Center for Academic Success  In addition to offering tutoring services for students on the main floor of Memorial Library, the Center for Academic Success maintains a list of helpful online resources:   https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/academics\/academic-support\/student-support-centers\/center-for-academic-success\/math-science-and-business\/resources#item-2      Accessibility Resources  Minnesota State University, Mankato provides students with disabilities reasonable accommodation to participate in educational programs, activities, or services. These include both permanent and temporary disabilities. Students requiring accommodation to engage in class activities or meet course requirements should first register with Accessibility Resources (Memorial Library 132, telephone 389-2825, TDD 711) to establish an accommodation plan. After that, they should contact me for any needed course-specific arrangements.  You can find information on getting started at   https:\/\/mankato.mnsu.edu\/university-life\/campus-services\/accessibility-resources\/getting-started\/      Veteran's Information  Veterans and active duty military personnel with special circumstances are welcome and encouraged to communicate these. Resources for veterans are available at   https:\/\/mankato.mnsu.edu\/university-life\/campus-services\/veterans\/veterans-resource-center\/      Maverick Food Pantry  The Maverick Food Pantry is an important campus initiative that provides both perishable and non-perishable food, as well as basic toiletries, to students experiencing food insecurity. No student should have to choose between eating and learning. Good nutrition is a critical foundation for academic performance—affecting energy levels, focus, memory, and overall well-being.  If you're not getting enough to eat, it can significantly hinder your ability to concentrate, retain information, and stay motivated. Addressing food insecurity is not just about physical health—it's about supporting your success as a student. The Maverick Food Pantry exists to ensure that all students have the fuel they need to thrive academically and personally.

  "title": "University Policies",
  "body": " University Policies   This section outlines university-wide policies. These policies apply to all classes at the university unless specifically stated otherwise.    Credit Hours Policy  According to university policy, each credit hour represents one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of independent student work per week, typically over a 15-week semester. This applies equally to traditional semester-long courses and to accelerated or alternative delivery formats, which must involve the same total amount of learning time.  In practical terms, this means that for a standard 3-credit course, you should plan to spend 6–9 hours per week outside of class actively engaging with course material. For a 4-credit course, the expectation rises to 8–12 hours weekly. This time includes reading, working on practice problems, completing assignments, reviewing notes, visiting office hours or other academic support systems, and preparing for exams.  Regular, distributed practice is essential for learning complex material like mathematics. Research in cognitive science consistently shows that spreading out your study time—rather than condensing it into long, infrequent sessions—leads to better long-term retention and deeper understanding. Setting aside 1–2 hours each day to review concepts and complete coursework is far more effective than a single weekly “cram session.”  Making time for consistent, focused practice is not just about keeping up with assignments—it's about training your brain to think mathematically. By returning to material frequently, you give yourself repeated opportunities to reinforce knowledge and make meaningful connections, both of which are essential for academic success.  You can read the full university policy, including definitions of credit hours for online, hybrid, and other non-traditional course formats, at:   https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/academic-credit-hour-definition\/      University Sponsored or Sanctioned Activities and Makeup Work  Students represent the university through participation in university-sponsored or -sanctioned activities, i.e. representing the university at off-campus co-curricular events. When the activity conflicts with academic obligations, student-participants will follow a standard protocol to provide their faculty members with prior, written notification of their absences from classes. Faculty members will determine, in consultation with student participants, how missed classes and assignments are made-up in a manner that fulfills academic obligations and accommodates participatory obligations.  Except for absences resulting from sponsored or sanctioned activities, student-participants have the same responsibility in regard to class attendance and assignments as do all other students.  The full policy is available at https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/missed-classes-for-university-sponsored-or-sanctioned-activities-and-makeup-work-policy\/      University Grading Policy   A student's work in any course will be evaluated to align with the following university grade system and governing policies. Final gradelines as a percent grade may be modified to better reflect these expectations, but only in students' favor if gradelines are already provided in the individual course description.        Undergraduate Grading     University Description  Instructor's Description    A  Superior level of performance  Demonstrates mastery of course material and consistently exceeds course expectations.    B  Above-average level of performance  Shows strong understanding of course material and meets most course objectives.    C  Average level of performance  Indicates satisfactory understanding of course material and meets basic course objectives.    D  Below-average level of performance  Indicates not adequately meeting course objectives or demonstration of sufficient mastery of course material.    F  Failing level of performance  Indicates failure to meet course objectives and demonstated a significant lack of understanding of the material.         Graduate Grading     University Description  Instructor's Description    A  Superior level of performance  Demonstrates mastery of course material and consistently exceeds course expectations.    B  Above-average level of performance  Shows strong understanding of course material and meets most course objectives.    C  Below-average level of performance  Indicates satisfactory understanding of course material and meets basic course objectives.    D  Unacceptable level of performance  Indicates not adequately meeting course objectives or demonstration of sufficient mastery of course material.    F  Failing level of performance  Indicates failure to meet course objectives and demonstated a significant lack of understanding of the material.     Graduate students should be aware that while the Instructor’s Description of assignments and grading remains consistent for both undergraduate and graduate students (as indicated in the third column), the University’s Description of letter grades differs. Specifically, graduate students are held to a higher academic standard.  At the graduate level, the minimum acceptable performance is considered “above average” by university standards. This means that simply fulfilling the basic requirements of an assignment may not be sufficient for a high grade. Graduate students are expected to demonstrate a deeper, more critical understanding of course material, engage with concepts at a higher level of abstraction, and communicate their insights with clarity, precision, and intellectual rigor.  In addition, graduate-level work demands stronger metacognitive skills—such as the ability to reflect on one’s own learning, identify areas for growth, and adjust approaches accordingly. These heightened expectations align with the broader goals of graduate education: to cultivate independent thinkers, researchers, and professionals capable of contributing original ideas to their field.  While course content and assignments may overlap in cross-listed undergraduate\/graduate courses, graduate students are evaluated by more rigorous standards, particularly in terms of depth of analysis, scholarly engagement, and critical thinking.   The grade of Incomplete (I) is reserved for special cases. A student and instructor must complete and sign an Incomplete Contract that specifies the assigned grade of \"I\" for the course and outlines requirements for its completion.  The full university grading policy is available at   https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/grading\/      Grade Appeals Policy  Students have the right to ask an instructor for an explanation of any grade received. Grade appeals are reviewed in instances where students perceive that a final course grade is unfair , arbitrary , or capricious . Students must begin the procedures of this policy within two weeks* of university notification of a final course grade.   *The time period consists of normal university operating days when classes are held. Under unusual circumstances, deadlines may be extended. If the University representative, at any step, fails to review and\/or respond within the time limits provided, the student may proceed to the next step. If the student fails to respond within the time limits provided, the appeal shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.   Students should retain copies of all materials associated with this process for their records. Students should also have records of their coursework from the class as part of the appeal process and be able to clearly explain why they believe their letter grade assignment does not align with university grading policies as outlined in .  The full policy is available at https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/grade-appeals\/ .     Academic Honesty Policy  As members of the university community, students are expected to fulfill their academic responsibilities with integrity and honesty. This includes avoiding misconduct such as plagiarism, cheating, or collusion. Violations of academic honesty may result in both academic consequences (such as a lowered grade or failing the course) and disciplinary actions (such as probation, suspension, or expulsion).  The full policy, including official definitions of plagiarism, cheating, and collusion, can be found at:   https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/academic-honesty\/      Electronic Recording of Lectures   This policy exists to protect the use of copyrighted materials included in this course. Recording, sharing, or distributing course content without explicit permission may violate copyright laws. Such actions can result in disciplinary measures by the university and may also carry legal consequences. Additionally, uploading course materials to websites such as Chegg without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited and constitutes a copyright violation.   Students are not permitted to record lectures or make electronic copies of course materials (e.g., slides, formulas, lecture notes) using personal recording devices (e.g., smart phone, tablet, computer, digital recorder) unless prior written permission from faculty is obtained and students who appear in the recordings or course materials do not object. The policy applies to all forms of course delivery (e.g., on-campus, online).  Student attendance in a FlexSync course implies student consent to be recorded.  Permission is limited to a student’s educational use during a course. Recordings and materials must be destroyed at the end of each term. Students who do not destroy recordings and materials may be subject to disciplinary action.  Unauthorized downloading, file sharing, distribution of all or part of a recorded lecture or course materials or using information for purposes other than the student's own learning may be deemed a violation of this policy and subject to disciplinary action.  ADA Accomodations  In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), students may record and retain classroom lectures and instructional materials as part of an approved accommodation plan coordinated by the Office of Accessibility Resources in consultation with the student and faculty. However, as stated elsewhere in this policy, recorded lectures or copied materials must be destroyed at the end of each term.  The full policy is available at https:\/\/admin.mnsu.edu\/organizational-information\/policies-procedures\/university-policies\/electronic-recording-of-lectures-and-materials\/ .    "

BitMoji made a version which includes a cartoon avatar of your instructor.      I'm Dr. Hollingsworth (call me Dr. !), and I am a new(ish) Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics within Minnesota State University, Mankato. I grew up in the Ozark Mountains in North Central Arkansas, and I spent a lot of time outdoors hiking, bicycling, and hammock camping. I don't get a lot of time for hiking or camping these days, but I still commute to campus by bicycle or electric kick-scooter almost every day.  I started homeschooling after sixth grade, with almost no math curriculum. Consequently, I didn't really start learning mathematics until I started at the community college when I was 25.    Before that, I spent 6 years as a (self-taught) computer programmer working primarily on transportation and logistics software for line haul trucking companies, followed by 2 years as a freelance photographer (My favorite CV line item from this time is being published in a magazine titled Blood & Thunder !). At school, I started as a business major with a minor in studio art, and the major quickly changed to mathematics. I eventually transfered and graduated from the University of Central Arkansas with a BA in Mathematics and a minor in studio art (mostly printmaking and ceramics). After taking a year off to teach at a community college, I went to the University of Delaware for my Master's and Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics, writing my dissertation on the underlying mathematical framework for high-dimensional signal processing and studying constructions of such schemes. Now, I spend a lot of time crafting materials for the courses I teach (like this one!) and do my best to help students succeed.  I have lived in North Mankato for two years now with my amazing partner and our dog Gemma. We all enjoy cooking (well, Gemma enjoys eating), reading, and bicycling. We enjoy good coffee (we use an Aeropress) and I enjoy cleaning, although neither of the other two do. Most of my free time\/weekends are spent on home-improvement projects.   On campus, I am teaching two sections of MATH122 Calculus II and one section of MATH605 Graphs and Algorithms. I am also  running a math playground at the Children's Museum of Southern Minnesota and writing a book on Algebraic Combinatorics and Optimization. I stay busy!  You can follow my dog Gemma's personal adventures on her Instagram (@GemmaIsAGoodGirl), which just shows you that my dog is better at social media than I am. However, you can find me online through my website (woefully in need of updating) at sites.google.com\/view\/math-kgh .  "
