  <title>MATH122 - Calculus 2</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This course builds on your foundation in calculus by introducing advanced integration techniques, applications of integration, improper integrals, numerical methods, calculus of parametric curves, and infinite sequences and series. These topics are core analytical tools used throughout science, engineering, and applied mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      If some of this terminology is unfamiliar, that’s expected, you're taking this course to start learning these concepts!
      The first section below outlines the kinds of <em>problems</em> and <em>questions</em> these concepts help us address—from modeling physical systems to analyzing complex data. By the end of the course, you’ll have a basic understanding of how calculus might help with rigorous problem-solving in STEM fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to mastering these new topics, you’ll continue to reinforce fluency with essential skills from arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and Calculus I. These fundamentals remain critical across the sciences for precisely quantifying and interpreting relationships in real-world systems.
