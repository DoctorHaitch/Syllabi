  <title>MATH122 - Calculus 2</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
    This course will cover topics in (official course catalog description)
    techniques of integration, applications of integration, improper integrals,
    numerical integration, the calculus of parametric curves,
    and infinite series and sequences.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>Why study calculus?</title>
    <p>
      This rigorous mathematical subject consists of a basic mathematical tool kit for dealing with
      processes that change continuously.
      Part of the reason that calculus turns out to be so useful is that the details of the process
      turn out not to matter so much -- all that matters is that the process is continuous.
      In fact, if the increments are small enough, discrete processes can sometimes be approximated as
      continuous and treated using the techniques of calculus.
      More specifically, Calculus is the story of infinitely improving approximations concerned with
      two historical problems:
      <ol>
        <li>The slope of a "curvy line" at a point.</li>
        <li>The area beneath a "curvy line".</li>
      </ol>
      Miraculously, these two problems, which may seem barely related except for the type of line they
      seek to study, turn out to be deeply intertwined.
      This semester, we will primarily focus on the second problem, but due to the dual nature of these
      problems the other is necessary and a skill which you hopefully developed during Calculus I.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to do well in <em>MATH122</em>, you need to work on developing both conceptual understanding and
    algebraic fluency.
    Conceptual understanding is necessary as memorized facts are not much help if you do not know how to use them.
    Algebraic fluency is required as knowing the basic concepts is not very helpful if you are unable to easily
    use them because your knowledge is not built on a firm foundation of the governing principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    By fluency, I mean that you can generally use them
    without thinking about them. Fluency is defined as the ability to speak or write a language <alert>easily</alert> and 
    <alert>accurately</alert>. Similar to your fluency in your native language, where you likely are fluent in 10000-20000 words,
    you are expected to be fluent in a number of "mathematical rules" which you have learned over the last several years.
    Note, there is a full inventory of the algebraic, trigonometric, and Calculus I skills with which you need to be fluent
    in (TODO:INSERT REFERENCE HERE ONCE IT IS PORTED TO PRETEXT). 
  </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Prequisites</title>
    <p>
      Formally, being enrolled in MATH122 requires having passed MATH121 with a 'C' or better, or
      explicit consent of the instructor. Any student being found not to meet these requirements
      will automatically receive a failing grade at the end of the semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, Calculus II depends heavily on <alert>algebra</alert>, <alert>analytic geometry</alert>,
      <alert>trigonometry</alert> and your knowledge from <alert>Calculus I</alert>.
      Several review worksheets are posted on D2L Brightspace to help you recall the knowledge that
      will help you succeed in Calculus II this semester.
      A list of specific material that will be used to scaffold new knowledge can be found in the 
      Expected Prior Knowledge section. (TODO:Reference to Expected Knowledge Section).
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Learning Outcomes</title>
    <p>Upon completion of this course students will have demonstrated
      <ol>
        <li>a working knowledge of Riemann integration theory and several specific applications. 
          This will build off material from <em>MATH121: Calculus I</em>.</li>
        <li>a working knowledge of sequences, series, and their relevance to calculus.</li>
        <li>their ability to memorize, derive, and practice facts (the derivatives and 
          antiderivatives of basic functions, for instance) and fundamental theorems.</li>
        <li>understanding what is going on behind the symbols by developing the patterns
          of thought and the problem-solving skills needed when dealing with problems involving
          continuous change and difficult integrals. If you limit yourself to memorizing facts
          and formulas, you will miss out on this very important part of the course, which makes
          calculus so important for so many application areas.
        </li>
        <li>team work skills by collaborating within a small group, towards completion of a
          common task or goal.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Course Delivery</title>
    <p>
      Sessions will be in person.
      Many classes will require you to complete a 'pre-class assignment' to be turned in at the start of class.
      Lectures will be interactive and often be interrupted or replaced by individual or small group practice.
      You are expected to participate in class.
      If you are having trouble understanding anything please feel free to raise your hand and ask about it,
      or discuss it with your peers during the group work times.
      If you are not comfortable doing this, please email me, visit my drop-in practice hours,
      schedule an appointment during office hours, or ask immediately after class.

    <title>Course Outline</title>
    <p>
      A planned schedule for the semester is provided at the end of this document.
      Please see it for important dates such as <alert>quizzes</alert> and <alert>exams</alert>.

    <p>
      Roughly, our semester is organized to study the following questions (in order):
      <ol>
        <li>
          How can the relationships between integrals and derivatives help us model real-world phenomena?
          In general, how can integration help us calculate useful quantities?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>
        <li>
          What can we do when the anti-derivative is not obvious?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>
        <li>
          How do we work with curves that are not functions or perform Calculus in other coordinate systems?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>
        <li>
          How do we deal with quantities involving infinity that still result in finite answers?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, when our techniques from answering (2) fail (or are impossible), can we still
          find meaningful answers to Calculus questions? If so, how?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>

    <title>Subsequent Courses and Programs</title>
    <p>
      To give a sense of the scale, scope, and importance of Calculus II, this
      is the current list of courses which require Calculus II with a 'C' or better
      as an entry requirement. Note, for Computer Science, many of your classes list
      <em>MATH247: Linear Algebra</em>, which is dependent on Calculus II. This is
      likely true for other programs as well, and I'd like to get a similar list for
      <em>MATH247</em> in the near future.
