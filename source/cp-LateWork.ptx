    <title>Equity and Inclusion</title>
    <p>
      <alert>I want you to succeed in this class!</alert>
      As your professor I pledge to work to create an equitable learning environment, where all students belong.
      Mathematics can seem like the most objective of school subjects, but like all education, mathematics education is a cultural activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      How we experience the world outside of math classes affect how we experience math classes.
      There is considerable research on how students` \emph{sense of belonging} in their math classes impacts their learning.
      Feeling like you don't belong in a class can impact your cognitive load and diminish your ability to focus on the mathematics;
      so for example, you might use your brain to worry whether the professor or your classmates will think you are stupid if you make a mistake;
      to deal with the impact of a racist, sexist, classist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist microaggression;
      or to wonder whether the other students are better than you.
    </p>

      William Yslas Vélez said,
      ``If a student finds pleasure and joy in finding a solution, in understanding a new concept,
      then this emotion is a sign of belonging to the mathematical community" (<emph>Imposter Syndrome</emph>, AMS e-Mentoring Network, posted 1/25/2019).
      Although frustration and struggle are also part of the mathematical enterprise, ultimately I see my work as setting up situations where all students have the opportunity to experience the joy of mathematics, to experience a sense of belonging, and to use our brains for learning math.

  <title>Student Diversity</title>
  <p>
    The diversity of the participants in this course is a valuable source of ideas, problem solving strategies, and computational creativity.
    I consider this classroom to be a place where you will all be treated with respect, and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability – and other visible and nonvisible differences.
    All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.

  <title>Commitment to Anti-Racist Pedagogy</title>
  <p>
    (Adapted from <emph>White Supremacy Culture Still Here</emph> by Tema Okun)
  </p>
  <p>
    White supremacy refers to the ways in which the ruling class elite or the power elite in the colonies
    of what was to become the United States used the pseudo-scientific concept of race to create whiteness
    and a hierarchy of racialized value in order to:
    <ul>
      <li>disconnect and divide white people from Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC);</li>
      <li>disconnect and divide Black, Indigenous, and People of Color from each other;</li>
      <li>disconnect and divide white people from other white people;</li>
      <li>disconnect and divide each and all of us from the earth, the sun, the wind,
        the water, the stars, the animals that roam(ed) the earth;</li>
      <li>disconnect and divide each of us from ourselves and from 
        <url href="https://www.whitesupremacyculture.info/what-is-it.html">Keanu Reeves</url>.</li>
    </ul>
    With a commitment to dismantling white supremacy, in my courses <emph>we will</emph>:
    <ol>
      <li>learn to admit when we are wrong. Understand that vulnerability can be a strength,
        particularly if you are sitting in a position of power and privilege;</li>
      <li>understand that discomfort is at the root of all growth and learning;</li>
      <li>welcome discomfort and learn to sit with discomfort before responding or acting;</li>
      <li>avoid taking everything personally; we are all just human, glory and warts and genius and faults and all;</li>
      <li>create a culture where people feel they can bring problems to the group; use meetings as a place to solve problems, not just a place to report activities;</li>
      <li>create a culture of inquiry about what constitutes the "right way" and what defines a "mistake";</li>
      <li>develop your skills individually and collectively to gather information through different ways of knowing;
        appreciate when others learn from and expand on our knowledge and writing; see ourselves and position ourselves
        as one person in a stream of knowing and learning;</li>
      <li>remember that feedback may be skillful or unskillful and either way, it will not kill you;</li>
      <li>understand the link between defensiveness and fear (of losing power, losing face, losing comfort, losing privilege);
        work on our own defensiveness; ask ourselves what we are defending against and why;</li>
      <li>learn to recognize those times when you need to go off the planned agenda in order to address
        people's underlying concerns with the knowledge that doing so will result in a more solid product
        in the long term; understand that everything takes longer than anyone expects.
      </li>
    </ol>
