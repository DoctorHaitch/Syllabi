    <p>
      Formally, being enrolled in MATH170 requires having passed MATH121 with a 'C' or better, or
      explicit consent of the instructor. Any student being found not to meet these requirements
      will automatically receive a failing grade at the end of the semester.

      In practice, this course requires a willingness to experiment and learn through asking questions, 
      discussing work and ideas with classmates, and reading documentation.
