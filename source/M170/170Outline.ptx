    <title>Course Outline</title>
    <p>
      Roughly speaking, our course will be organized into two sections. An introduction to computational thinking using Microsoft Excel which will last 4-6 weeks, and an introduction to Programming through Coordinate Geometry using OpenProcessing.org (note, we are waiting on approval from IT for use of this platform, so the plan may change depending on the status of IT's review).

            Please note, this is my first time teaching this particular course, so more details will be added or revised as needed.
            Please don't hesitate to ask questions or provide feedback on what would be helpful to include in this document for this and future semesters.
