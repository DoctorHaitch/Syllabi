  <introduction>
    <p>
      Your final grade in this course will be based on your demonstrated understanding of the course learning outcomes, as shown through a variety of assessments. The table below shows each assessment type along with its weight toward your final grade. Descriptions for each assessment follow the table.

    <p>
      <alert>Assessments in this class will be focused on developing knowledge and habits for success in computational thinking and mathematics.</alert>
      In real-world problem solving—especially in STEM—understanding the process is often more important than getting the "right" number.
      That is why this class will focus on process-thinking and developing strategies for success more often than short assignments with a "right" answer.
      Often, there will be many "right" ways to approach a problem, and being will to explore, question, and communicate your own process will be
      a large component of this course.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to help you build both confidence and competence in mathematical and computational thinking.
      These are lifelong skills with value across all scientific and technical fields.

    <p>
      This is a take-home quiz. You may use resources such as your textbook, tutoring services, office hours, or group study. It will be handed out on the first day of class and is due on Thursday of the first week.
