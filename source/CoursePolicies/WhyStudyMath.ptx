  <title>Why Study Math?</title>

  <p>
    One of the most common questions I get when people find out I teach mathematics is: “Why should anyone study math?” It’s a fair question—and one worth exploring seriously, especially for students in STEM fields. Mathematics isn’t just about numbers or equations; it’s a foundational discipline that trains your brain, shapes your thinking, and helps you understand the world in a deeper and more structured way. Here are a few key reasons why studying mathematics is valuable—regardless of your eventual career path.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><alert>Mathematics is the basic language of science:</alert> Math is the language through which we describe patterns, relationships, and phenomena in nearly every scientific field—from physics and engineering to biology and economics. Gaining fluency in this language takes time, practice, and effort—just like learning to speak any other language. But once you speak math, you unlock the ability to express complex ideas with clarity and precision.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><alert>It develops powerful problem-solving skills:</alert> Mathematics is a training ground for your mind. Every problem you tackle requires you to interpret given information, analyze relationships, identify patterns, and pursue a logical strategy toward a solution. This process is excellent preparation not just for exams, but for real-world situations where you need to solve unfamiliar problems with limited information.</p>
      <p>Additionally, math helps cultivate <em>habits of mind</em>: persistence, attention to detail, critical thinking, and adaptability. One key challenge students face in problem-solving is the <alert>Einstellung effect</alert> (see note below)—a tendency to rely too heavily on familiar methods even when better options exist. Mathematical practice helps you recognize and overcome these mental traps, making you a more flexible and creative thinker.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><alert>Mathematics is inherently beautiful:</alert> Math is not just useful—it’s also an art form. Writers like Dante, Melville, and Lewis Carroll wove mathematical themes into their literature. Artists such as da Vinci, Escher, and Kandinsky used mathematical structures to inspire their work. The study of mathematics allows you to see hidden patterns, symmetry, and elegance in the world around you. Even if you don’t pursue a mathematical career, learning to appreciate this beauty can enrich your thinking and your life.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><alert>The Einstellung effect:</alert> Also known as <em>cognitive fixation</em>, this is a psychological phenomenon where prior experience with a particular type of solution makes it harder to see better or more efficient alternatives. It’s a cognitive bias that causes us to stick with familiar approaches—even when they no longer work. In math courses, this often arises after solving many similar problems, and then encountering a new problem that breaks the expected pattern. The only way to consistently overcome this bias is through deliberate practice, reflection, and a willingness to adapt your approach.</p>
