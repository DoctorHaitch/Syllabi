  <title>Course Feedback and Grade Tracking</title>

  <p>
    Feedback is an essential component of the learning process in this course. Marked assignments are typically returned during regular class meetings. If you are absent on a day when feedback is distributed—usually when the next graded assessment is returned—you will need to either wait until the following distribution day or visit the instructor during office hours to collect your graded work.

    Grades will be recorded directly on your returned assignments and may or may not be posted to D2L. You are responsible for tracking your own progress throughout the semester. Keeping a personal record of your scores will help you stay informed, monitor your performance, and make strategic decisions about your study habits.

    As students in a mathematics course, you are expected to be able to calculate your own course grade using the weight structure provided in the course syllabus. In most of the instructor’s courses, exam grades are weighted using a flexible structure: your highest exam score receives the greatest weight, and your lowest exam score the least. This policy is intended to reflect that all course material is important, while also recognizing that students may have an off day. The goal is to reward consistent performance and reduce the impact of a single poor test result. Because most online gradebooks do not support this type of weighting, your final grade cannot be automatically calculated in the course Learning Management System.

    If you have questions about how to interpret feedback, calculate your course grade, or improve your performance based on instructor comments, you are strongly encouraged to attend office hours or reach out via email. Making use of feedback is a key part of your success in this course.
