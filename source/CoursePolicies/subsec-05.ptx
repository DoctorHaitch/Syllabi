  <title>Attendance and Emergency Preparedness</title>

  <p>
    Regular attendance is expected in each class, as much of the learning will occur through
    in-class activities and collaboration with peers. However, I recognize that students may
    occasionally face disruptions due to communicable illnesses (such as COVID-19 or measles),
    extreme weather, or other unexpected events.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need to miss class, please notify the instructor as early as possible.
    When appropriate, we will work together to develop a plan for staying on track
    with course material and assignments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Students are expected to maintain an <em>average attendance rate of 90% or higher</em>.
    Consistent absences without communication may prompt outreach from the instructor and/or
    your academic advisor. <em>Note: Students with attendance rates below 85% have historically
    been at significantly higher risk of failing the course.</em>

    <alert>Public Health:</alert> This course will follow evolving guidance from the university and public health authorities. As of now, masks are not required in the classroom, but this may change during the semester depending on university policy. Students are expected to respect each other’s health decisions and contribute to an inclusive and supportive learning environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are feeling unwell, you should stay home or wear a mask to class to protect yourself and your peers. All course policies are subject to change in response to updated guidance. In the event of widespread health concerns, courses will shift modalities or expectations in accordance with university policy.
