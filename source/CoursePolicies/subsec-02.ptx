  <title>Late Work and Missed Assessments</title>

  <p>
    <alert>Missed Assignments:</alert> Assignments in this course are intentionally designed to help you prepare for upcoming assessments and to deepen your understanding of key concepts. To ensure fairness and maintain academic integrity, solutions or feedback are often shared on or shortly after the original due date. For this reason, late submissions will not be accepted for any assignment once solutions have been released, the relevant assessment has taken place, or graded work has been returned.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are unable to attend class on the day an assignment is due, you may email a digital copy to the instructor before class begins to timestamp your submission. The physical copy should then be submitted at the next class meeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because late submissions create additional grading and administrative overhead, they are subject to a cumulative penalty: the first late assignment will be accepted at full credit; the second will receive a 25% deduction; the third, a 50% deduction; and the fourth and all subsequent late submissions will receive no credit. Additionally, late work will be placed at the bottom of the grading queue. While every effort will be made to provide feedback, timely grading is not guaranteed, and in rare cases, late work may not be graded until the week of final exams.
  </p>

  <p>
    Submitting work on time is essential for staying on track with the course and for benefiting fully from instructor feedback. Meeting deadlines ensures that material is completed while it is still relevant and that you are well-prepared for future assessments. Delays often result in missed opportunities for reflection, clarification, and academic growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Students are expected to manage their time responsibly and communicate proactively. If you anticipate a conflict or difficulty meeting a deadline due to extenuating circumstances, you must contact the instructor in advance to discuss possible accommodations. Requests made after a deadline will generally not be considered unless otherwise stated in an individual assignment or course policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    An exception to this policy applies to University-Sanctioned Events, as described in <xref ref="university-sponsored-activities" />. In such cases, students must communicate in advance to make arrangements for meeting assignment deadlines or completing alternate work.
  </p>

  <p>
    <alert>Missed Exams:</alert> Exams may be made up only during the same calendar week as the university’s final exam period. No other make-up opportunities will be offered. Shorter assessments may be eligible for make-up during office hours or through department provided proctoring at the instructor’s discretion.
  </p>

  <p>
    To request a make-up, students must email the instructor as soon as possible after missing the scheduled assessment. No documentation is required or expected—timely communication is sufficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    This policy ensures consistency and fairness while accommodating occasional, unavoidable conflicts. Consolidating make-ups into the final exam week helps maintain instructional continuity and supports efficient grading throughout the semester.
