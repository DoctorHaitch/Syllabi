  <title>Comments on AI Usage and Academic Integrity</title>
  <!--Adapted from an Open Letter to Students: https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1kfeswe/an_open_letter_to_my_students/ -->

  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT and other language models, are now widely accessible and increasingly powerful. They can assist with a range of academic tasks, from generating ideas to solving problems and drafting responses. Used thoughtfully, they can be a meaningful part of your learning process. However, they are not a replacement for learning itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Professionals in fields such as computer science, economics, engineering, and physics have raised concerns about over-reliance on AI. A common theme is that foundational skills—critical thinking, problem solving, and conceptual understanding—are not being sufficiently developed. These are the very skills that allow experts to adapt when tools fail, when new techniques are needed, or when a deeper understanding is required. Without them, you may find yourself unprepared in real-world situations where AI alone is not enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    Responsible use of AI involves a thoughtful feedback loop: asking good questions, interpreting AI-generated output with a critical eye, cross-checking with your own understanding, and revising based on insight. Simply copying or submitting AI-generated work short-circuits this process. It not only raises concerns about academic integrity—it also undermines your ability to grow intellectually and professionally.

  <p>
    As your instructor, I recognize that AI is now part of the educational landscape. My goal is not to police its use, but to encourage its integration in ways that support genuine learning. I want you to graduate not only with a degree, but with the habits of mind that will sustain you in a rapidly changing world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your education is not a series of tasks to complete—it is a process of becoming. Learning to think for yourself is central to that process. When you avoid the struggle of learning by outsourcing it to an algorithm, you miss the opportunity to strengthen the very skills that education is meant to develop.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI can be a powerful partner in your education, but it must be used with care and integrity. Use it to clarify concepts, explore alternatives, and deepen your understanding—but do not let it think for you. Let it be a tool in your feedback loop, not a substitute for it.
  </p>

  <p>
    This course is designed to challenge you—not to discourage you, but to help you build the resilience and skill needed in any meaningful career or intellectual pursuit. You have the opportunity now to cultivate the habits that will serve you for a lifetime. Don't trade long-term growth for short-term convenience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's engage honestly, think critically, and use the best tools available—including AI—with responsibility and purpose.
