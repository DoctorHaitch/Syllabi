  <title>Comments on AI usage and Academic Integrity</title>
  <!--Adapted from an Open Letter to Students: https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1kfeswe/an_open_letter_to_my_students/ -->

  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly accessible and capable of producing work that may superficially resemble student-generated submissions. As your instructor, I want to address this honestly: many students across higher education—and perhaps even in my courses—are using AI to complete their assignments. While this may feel like a convenient solution in the short term, I encourage you to consider the deeper and longer-term consequences of that choice.

  <p>
    Submitting work generated by AI without critical engagement is not just a matter of academic dishonesty—it is a missed opportunity to grow intellectually and develop as a thinker. The university currently offers limited tools for detecting or enforcing restrictions on AI-generated content, which means that at times I may grade work that I strongly suspect was not created by the student. This creates a difficult ethical space. My primary goal is not to act as a surveillance system, but to support your development as an educated and capable person.

    Your education is more than a checklist of assignments and grades. It is an investment in the most valuable asset you will carry throughout your life: your mind. Relying on external tools to bypass the struggle of learning can leave you with credentials but without competence. The consequences of this are significant. Without the ability to think critically, evaluate evidence, question assumptions, and communicate persuasively, you may find yourself unprepared to navigate complex professional, civic, and personal challenges.

    An uneducated mind is easily manipulated, unable to discern nuance, and limited in perspective. In contrast, an educated mind enriches every aspect of life. It allows you to live more fully, to appreciate complexity, to contribute meaningfully to your community, and to face the world with confidence and clarity. These are not abstract ideals—they are practical, lifelong advantages.

    Regular practice, intellectual struggle, and reflection are how learning happens. These are the habits of mind that education is designed to instill. When you skip those steps, you don't just cheat the system—you cheat yourself of becoming the person you could be.
  </p>

  <p>
    This does not mean AI has no place in your education. When used ethically and thoughtfully—as a supplement rather than a substitute—it can enhance your learning. Translation tools, research assistance, and data analysis applications can be valuable resources. But using AI to do your thinking, writing, or problem-solving for you turns a powerful tool into a crutch. In those moments, you are robbing yourself of growth.

  <p>
    Generations before you have fought for the privilege of education. It is not too late to honor their sacrifices—and your own potential—by choosing to engage fully, honestly, and bravely with your education. This class is your opportunity to learn how to think for yourself. If you don't take that opportunity now, someone—or something—else will be thinking for you for the rest of your life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s use the tools of the present to build a stronger future—one rooted in integrity, critical thinking, and a commitment to lifelong learning.
