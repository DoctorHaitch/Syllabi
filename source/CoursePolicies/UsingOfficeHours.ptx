  <title>Effective Use of Office Hours</title>

  <p>
    Office hours are one of the most valuable resources available to you in any of your courses. They are dedicated times when you can meet with your instructor to ask questions, clarify concepts, and receive individualized support. You are <alert>strongly encouraged</alert> to take advantage of them, whether you're struggling, curious, or simply want to stay on track. Here are some effective ways to use office hours:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><alert>Get help with homework or assigned problems:</alert> Bring questions about specific problems you've attempted and want help understanding or solving.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><alert>Clarify difficult concepts from class:</alert> If something from lecture didn’t fully make sense, office hours are a great time to revisit and reinforce those ideas.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><alert>Explore how topics connect across courses:</alert> Discuss how the current material relates to what you’ve learned in previous math classes or how it might apply in future courses or real-world contexts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><alert>Get advice on effective study strategies:</alert> Learn how to take better notes, manage time, approach problem sets, and prepare for exams in a way that suits this course’s structure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><alert>Ask about academic or career pathways:</alert> Whether you're considering a math major, teaching certification, or a STEM-related field, office hours are a chance to get informed advice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><alert>Review feedback from graded assignments:</alert> Discuss mistakes you made and ask questions about how to improve or approach similar problems differently in the future.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><alert>Build rapport with your instructor:</alert> Forming a professional relationship can help you feel more comfortable asking questions and may lead to future opportunities like recommendation letters or research experiences.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You do not need to have a specific question prepared to attend office hours—sometimes simply talking through material aloud with your instructor can help clarify your thinking. Feel free to request a joint appointment with one or two classmates if you're working through the same material.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are three drop-in office hours as shown in <xref ref="office-hours-schedule" />. I also reserve several hours a week specifically for responding to student emails. All other times are available <em>by appointment</em> to allow for flexibility and to make the best use of the instructor's time across teaching, grading, student communication, and other university responsibilities. This model also helps ensure that the instructor meets the university’s 10-hour weekly student availability requirement in a sustainable and effective way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Appointments can be scheduled by emailing your instructor at <alert>kristopher (dot) hollingsworth (at) mnsu (dot) edu</alert>. You may schedule individually or as a small group if you'd prefer to review material collaboratively.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you happen to see the instructor's office door open, you are welcome to check in and ask if now is a good time for questions. However, please be aware that the instructor may be busy with other responsibilities, and students with scheduled appointments will be given priority.
