  <title>Welcome to the Course</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      <alert>I want you to succeed in this class!</alert>
      As your professor, I am committed to creating an equitable learning environment where all students feel they belong and are supported. 
      While mathematics is often perceived as objective and culture-free, mathematics education is deeply shaped by the cultural context in which it occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section of the syllabus, we will explore how identity, inclusion, and pedagogy intersect—and how these elements impact your experience as a student of mathematics.

    <title>Equity and Inclusion</title>

    <p>
      Our experiences outside of mathematics classrooms shape how we experience learning within them. Research has shown that students' <em>sense of belonging</em> in a math class significantly influences their learning outcomes. When students feel isolated or marginalized, their cognitive resources are diverted—often toward worries about how they are perceived, or managing the emotional toll of microaggressions.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, a student may spend energy wondering whether their classmates or instructor will judge them harshly for a mistake, or struggling internally with a racist, sexist, classist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist comment. These challenges interfere with learning and diminish the joy and discovery that mathematics can offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mathematician William Yslas Vélez once wrote, "If a student finds pleasure and joy in finding a solution, in understanding a new concept, then this emotion is a sign of belonging to the mathematical community" (<em>Imposter Syndrome</em>, AMS e-Mentoring Network, 1/25/2019). While frustration and struggle are natural parts of learning math, I strive to create an environment where all students have opportunities to experience joy, discovery, and belonging through mathematical thinking.

    <title>Student Diversity</title>

    <p>
      The diversity of our class is a valuable resource. Different backgrounds bring a wide range of problem-solving approaches, creative ideas, and insights. After years of teaching, I continue to be surprised and inspired by the questions and perspectives that students bring to our shared learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      This classroom is a space where all individuals will be treated with dignity and respect. I welcome students of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, and abilities—including both visible and nonvisible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, inclusive, and welcoming learning environment.

    <title>Commitment to Anti-Racist Pedagogy</title>

    <p>
      <em>(Adapted from “White Supremacy Culture Still Here” by Tema Okun)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The concept of white supremacy refers to how dominant power structures in the U.S. used pseudo-scientific ideas of race to create hierarchies of value—dividing people by race, class, and culture in ways that serve those in power. These systems of disconnection not only separate people from each other but also from the natural world and even from themselves. These power structures seek to
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>divide white people from Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC);</li>
      <li>divide BIPOC communities from each other;</li>
      <li>divide white people from other white people;</li>
      <li>disconnect all of us from the natural world and non-human life; and</li>
      <li>disconnect each person from their own sense of self and possibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In my courses, we commit to dismantling these harmful systems by practicing the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Admitting when we are wrong, understanding that vulnerability is a strength—especially for those with privilege or power.</li>
      <li>Recognizing that discomfort is a catalyst for growth and learning.</li>
      <li>Learning to sit with discomfort before reacting.</li>
      <li>Not taking everything personally—we all bring flaws and gifts to our shared learning.</li>
      <li>Creating a culture where it is safe to raise problems and challenges.</li>
      <li>Questioning norms about what is the "right way" and rethinking the meaning of "mistakes".</li>
      <li>Valuing multiple ways of knowing, and understanding ourselves as contributors to an evolving collective understanding.</li>
      <li>Receiving feedback with openness—whether it is skillful or unskillful and either way, it will not kill you.</li>
      <li>Recognizing defensiveness as rooted in fear and privilege; examining what we are protecting and why.</li>
      <li>Being willing to deviate from the agenda to address real human concerns, knowing that long-term learning benefits from this responsiveness.</li>
    </ol>
