      This section was originally created in Fall 2023 and will be updated as needed.  
      If you have suggestions or feedback, I'd be glad to hear from you—your input is always welcome!
    </p>

    <p>
      The <alert>purpose</alert> of this list is not to teach you the concepts from scratch.  
      Rather, it serves as a comprehensive reminder of the topics you’ve already studied and will need to use fluently in Calculus II.  
      Your textbook, online resources, and other references will likely <em>assume</em> you know these topics, which means they often won’t be explicitly explained in problems or solutions—even those found online.  
      This list provides the names and brief descriptions of key concepts to help you identify any gaps in your understanding.  
      It is your responsibility to ensure you're prepared to apply them whenever they arise, both in this course and beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
      What follows is a curated list of foundational topics that students often need in order to succeed in Calculus II.  
      For each, I’ve noted where you likely first encountered it, though you've probably seen them multiple times since.  
      This goes well beyond the general prerequisite of "Completed Calculus I with a C or better."
      These are the <em>specific</em> pieces of knowledge you'll be expected to build upon.
      Struggling with these concepts is a common reason students find Calculus II challenging.  
      You've invested many years into learning mathematics up to this point—you’re now expected to <em>master</em> and apply these ideas fluently.  
      <alert>Math is the language of many sciences, and these foundational concepts remain critical well beyond this course.</alert>
