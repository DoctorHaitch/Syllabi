  <title>Prerequisite Knowledge for Calculus II</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        This was originally written in Fall 2023, and will continue to evolve as necessary.
        Please let me know if you have suggested additions or revisions -- I'm happy
        to listen to your input or discuss this list!
    </p>

    <p>
        Below are specific topics I've found students need to scaffold their
        new Calculus II knowledge, and where I would expect you <em>first</em>
        encountered the topic, but you've likely seen each one multiple times
        in subsequent classes. This is much more specific than saying
        "Prerequisite: Completed Calculus I with a C or better".
        These are <em>specific</em> points of knowledge you need to build from.
        If you do not feel comfortable with the topics below, this is going to be
        where a lot of
        your potential struggle with Calculus II will likely come from.
        You've taken a good deal of mathematics to get here--and you are expected to have
        <em>mastered</em> these concepts in your prior 12+ years of mathematical training
        so you can apply them here fluenty and in all future classes.
        <alert>Math is the basic language of most sciences, and these concepts remain the
            foundation of many scientific fields--so they remain important outside of
            Calculus as well!</alert>

%This is something I've wanted to provide students for a while, but it's going to be a large undertaking to actually compile the list of expected previous knowledge for Calculus II.
This was originally written in Fall 2023, and will continue to evolve as necessary\footnote{Please let me know if you have suggested additions or revisions - I'm happy to listen to your input or discuss this list!}.
It lists the topics I've found students need to scaffold their new Calculus II knowledge, and where I would expect you \textit{first} encountered the topic.
This is much more specific than saying ``Prerequisite: Completed Calculus I with a C or better".
These are \textit{specific} points of knowledge you need to build from.
If you do not feel comfortable with the topics below, this is going to be where a lot of your struggle with Calculus II comes from.
You've taken a good deal of mathematics to get here-and you are expected to have \textit{mastered} these concepts in your prior 12+ years of mathematical training so you can apply them here and in all future classes.
\textbf{Math is the basic language of most sciences, and these concepts remain the foundation of many scientific fields-so they remain important outside of Calculus as well!}

\subsection*{Algebra}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Understand the difference between a mathematical function and a mathematical expression.
  \item How to find the distance between two points on a number line.

    \item You should be familiar with point-slope, slope-intercept, and two-point forms of the equation of a line.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The graphs of basic polynomial functions and n$^\text{th}$ root functions, and how translations and dilations alter them.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item You should understand how the geometric graph of a function relates to the algebraic function definition (ie, you should know the definition of the Cartesian plane).
     \item You should know about domains and ranges of functions, and the domains and ranges of a functions inverse in relation to the original.
  \end{enumerate}
  \newpage
  \item How to factor a polynomial equation. (There are several methods, know some of them!)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item General Strategies
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Factor by grouping
      \item Factor by guess and test (sometimes useful-and you \textit{should} know how to \textit{quickly} test that something is a factor!)
      \item Do not rely on graphs, graphs can be misleading.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Special Strategies for Quadratics
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item You can determine possible factors using quantities which multiply together to the constant, and add together to the coefficient on $x$
      \item The quadratic equation.
      \item Understand the discriminant and what it tells you about the roots of a quadratic function.
      \item Related: what factors can be irreducible over the real numbers and how to recognize them.
      \item Special formulas to expand perfect squares and factor a difference of squares (there are also special formulas for sum/difference of cubes, but these show up less often-but not never).
      \item Completing the Square (yes, you might actually need to know this in Calculus).\footnote{Also, if you want to study classical physics, Newton literally wrote a book called ``Conic Sections" - because they are that important. Recognizing Conic Sections is basically completing the square... over and over and over again.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Advanced strategies to find rational roots of higher order polynomials (not necessary, but nice to know)
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Descarte's Rule of Signs and the Rational Root Theorem
      \item `Quick' reduction by synthetic division (a shortcut form of long division)
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item How to add, subtract, multiply, and divide functions.
  \item Generally, what does it mean for two functions to be equal?
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Specifically, what it means for two polynomial functions to be equal?
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Rules of exponents (multiply same base, exponentiate an exponent, moving terms from numerator to denominator, etc...)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item How these are reflected in the rules for Logarithms.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The division algorithm applied to polynomials.
  \item The absolute value function
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The algebraic definition as both a piecewise function and in terms of radicals
    \item The graph of the function.

  \item How to sketch the graphs of rational functions.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify asymptotes and removable discontinuities.
    \item Determine limit behavior near asymptotes and towards plus/minus infinity.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\newpage

\subsection*{Calculus I}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The definition of a limit, and strategies for calculating them.
  \item The definition of the derivative of a function in terms of limits, and it's geometric interpretation.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item How to calculate the equation of a tangent line.
    \item What additional information the derivative gives you when sketching graphs of functions.
    \item This includes both first and second derivative tests and their geometric interpretations.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Derivatives of basic functions and the basic derivative rules.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Constant multiple, sum/difference, product, quotient (and how to derive it from product), and chain rules.
    \item Polynomials $x^n$. All six trig functions, exponential functions, and their inverses.
    \item Implicit differentiation. (For examples, take derivatives $dy/dx$ and $dx/dy$ of $y^2+3x^3-\sin(xy)=15$ or if $g$ is also a function of $x$, calculate $df/dx$ if $f = g^2\ln(\sin(g))$).
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The definition of an antiderivative.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The antiderivatives you obtain as a result of differentiating the functions above.
    \item Memorize the antiderivative of $\sec x$ and $\csc x$, but we'll (eventually) learn how to calculate them in Calculus II as well.
    \item How to calculate antiderivatives using algebraic manipulation.
    \item How to calculate antiderivatives using $u$-Substitution (and which differentiation rule it corresponds to)
    \item Why $+C$ appears in general antiderivatives (and why it doesn't for definite integrals)
  \end{enumerate}
  \newpage
  \item The definition of an integral in terms of a limit of Riemann sum approximations, and integration's geometric interpretation.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item How to calculate Riemann sum approximations (yes, those left, right, mid-point methods-yes, you actually need to know and understand those).
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The definitions of exponential and logarithmic equations.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item How to graph them and how translations and dilations alter them.
    \item How to solve equations involving them.
    \item How to simplify expressions involving them.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (you do not need to know it's proof by Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem, but it's nice to at least know that is why it's true...), and how it is used to evaluate definite integrals.
\end{enumerate}
