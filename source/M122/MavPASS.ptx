      MavPASS (Peer-Facilitated Academic Support System): This semester, we are
      offering additional support to help students to succeed in this course.
      Students who have taken this class in a previous semester have been hired
      as MavPASS Leaders to sit in on the course with you, facilitate study sessions
      outside of class, and hold office hours.

      Note, the two Working Sessions cover the same material, so you may
      attend whichever is more convenient for your schedule (you do not need to attend both, but you are welcome to, however only one per week may be used to earn Learning Problem points).
      You can also find the schedule at <url href="https://www.mnsu.edu/mavpass">www.mnsu.edu/mavpass</url>.
