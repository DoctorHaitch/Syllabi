  <title>Licensure Standards</title>

  <p>
    Students enrolled in <em>MATH 122 – Calculus II</em> at Minnesota State University, Mankato demonstrate competencies aligned with the Minnesota teacher licensure standards, as outlined in 
    <url href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/pdf/8710.4600/2014-01-18%2009:44:44+00:00">Minnesota Rule 8710.4600</url>.
    This course is part of the Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Teaching program and addresses the following standard components:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Standard 3A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</li>
    <li>Standard 3B: 4</li>
    <li>Standard 3C: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8</li>
    <li>Standard 3D: 1–5, 7–15</li>
    <li>Standard 3G: 1a–d, 2a–c, 3a–c, 4a–d</li>
    <li>Standard 3H: 1, 2, 3a–d</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The course content includes techniques and applications of integration, improper integrals, numerical methods, parametric equations, and infinite series and sequences. These align with competencies in the following areas:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><em>Understanding of Number Systems</em>: Includes whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers. Calculus specific studies analytic properties of the real number system, and sequences and series are related to both the reals and integers.</li>
    <li><em>Application of Mathematical Procedures</em>: Emphasizes recognizing patterns, analyzing variable relationships, and applying limits and boundedness in sequences and series.</li>
    <li><em>Use of Mathematical Representations</em>: Focuses on solving problems using tables, graphs, algebraic expressions, and verbal descriptions.</li>
    <li><em>Application of Calculus Concepts</em>: Covers differential and integral calculus, including infinite series and their representations.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This content is integrated with pedagogy through courses such as <em>MATH484 – Technology in Secondary School Mathematics</em> and <em>MATH485 – Teaching Secondary School Mathematics</em>, equipping future educators with both subject knowledge and effective instructional strategies.
  </p>

  <p>
    By meeting the standards above, <em>MATH122 – Calculus II</em> plays a key role in preparing students to meet Minnesota licensure requirements and excel as secondary mathematics teachers.
