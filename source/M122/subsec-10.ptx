      <p>
        <alert>In general, I am not primarily interested in your final answers—I am far more concerned with your ability to clearly demonstrate an understanding of the process that leads to those answers.</alert>
        This emphasis on process is intentional: it reflects the reality that in real-world problem solving, especially in STEM fields, knowing how to arrive at a correct solution is just as important—if not more so—than the solution itself. For this reason, I provide final answers for most out-of-class practice problem sets, so you can focus your effort on understanding the steps that lead to those solutions.
      </p>
      <p>On quizzes and exams, partial credit will be minimal unless you include clear, valid, and logical supporting work. I want to see how you reason through a problem, not just whether you can arrive at the right number.</p>
      <p>Additionally, while not all techniques we study in this course will be equally relevant to every student—given the diverse majors represented in Calculus II—the foundational mathematical skills you develop will remain relevant in all future STEM courses. Demonstrating fluency with these core skills—such as algebraic manipulation, mathematical reasoning, and structured problem-solving—not only reinforces your conceptual understanding now but also builds a toolkit you’ll continue to rely on as problems become more complex and domain-specific.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, my goal is to help you build both confidence and competence in your problem-solving process, which is a transferable skill across all scientific and technical disciplines.</p>

      <title>Exams</title>

      <p>
        About one week prior to each chapter exam, a practice problem set will be posted. These sets will include approximately 80 problems, some of which will appear directly on the exam. If you have been consistently completing the required practice problem sets, this packet will serve as effective review and reinforcement.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if you have not completed the ongoing practice, it is not realistic to expect that you can work through the entire problem set in the time available. Instead, use it strategically: scan through the problems to identify content areas where you feel uncertain or cannot immediately determine how to begin. If you find yourself unable to sketch out a general solution process for a problem, that topic likely needs further review.
      </p>

      <p>
        To reinforce these areas, you are encouraged to bring questions from the packet to academic support resources such as MavPASS sessions, the Math and Statistics Learning Center, office hours, or the Center for Academic Success. For more information on these resources, see <xref ref="StudentResources"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exams will be completed in class and will follow a traditional format. Approximately 50% of each exam will consist of problems taken directly from the study packet. The remaining questions will be drawn from or modeled on problems from the Required Practice problem sets, Preclass Assignments, Groupwork Assignments, and Quizzes.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection xml:id="exam-revisions">
      <title>Exam Revisions</title>
      <p>
        Students who are meeting course expectations will have the opportunity to earn back partial credit by submitting written reflections and corrected solutions after receiving a graded exam. This revision process is designed to reinforce understanding and promote deeper learning, as well as allowing students to learn from their mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be eligible for exam revision credit, students must meet at least one of the following requirements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Maintain an <alert>average class attendance</alert> of at least <alert>85%</alert>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Maintain a <alert>Required Practice Journal</alert> in which every section is present and at least 70% complete.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Attend a <alert>MavPASS session</alert> for each Required Practice problem set that is below 70% completion.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As your instructor, I fully expect you to make mistakes—that’s part of the learning process. However, it remains essential that you approach each exam with serious preparation and genuine effort. Revisions are not a substitute for studying; they are a structured opportunity to reflect on your performance, identify patterns in your understanding, and strengthen the academic habits that support long-term success.
      </p>

      <p>
        The revision process is designed to help you engage more deeply with the material and to develop critical skills such as self-assessment, persistence, and metacognitive awareness. If one or more exams do not go as planned, revisions allow you to recover some credit while learning how to better prepare for future assessments.
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, revisions should not be viewed as a fallback or safety net. Students who rely on revisions instead of putting forth their best effort from the outset often fall behind in the course and struggle to catch up. Use revisions as a learning tool—not a crutch. The goal is not just to improve your grade, but to grow as an independent and resilient learner.

<!--
\noindent\underline{\textbf{``Required Practice" and Preclass Assignments}}:

\noindent
While homework will not be collected or graded during each content section, practice problem sets are posted on D2L a day before each section of the textbook is discussed in class.
Students are expected to maintain a \emph{homework journal} in which they record their final solutions (notice I stated \textit{solutions} and not \textit{answers}) to each problem.
\textbf{This should not include every attempt,} rather you should attempt it in another notebook or on scratch paper (or similar) before \emph{neatly} recording your final answer in your journal.
This has numerous benefits to your learning.
The process of neatly organizing your thoughts will help you understand and master the material, create a legible reference for studying for quizzes and exams, and give you practice clearly communicating complex information to others.
Additionally, you will often catch many of your own errors if you do this thoughtfully.

\vfill

\noindent\hrulefill

\noindent
{\footnotesize $^1$ I reserve the right to modify this if grades do not appear to reflect a student's \textbf{learning} as described in the University Grading Policy, but only in a students favor. Please note \textbf{learning} and \textbf{effort} are different concepts - so please make sure you are spending your time wisely and productively throughout the semester.}
\newpage

Due dates are provided as ``target dates'' on D2L to give you an idea of when work should reasonably be completed to stay on track with the course content. but under this system you may miss deadlines with no \textit{direct} penalty.
If you fall significantly behind, this will indirectly impact your course grade in several ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item You will not be prepared to collaborate with your classmates to complete in-class assignments and group works. % I may occasionally (once per week) ask your group to complete one or two of the recently due homework problems at the start of class and then turn them in as a warm-up.
  \item You will not have practiced sufficiently to do well on the exams and quizzes.
%  \item You will miss out on required practice points (see below) necessary to complete exam revisions. 
  \item Many problems in the preclass assignment will come from previous homework sets. If you have already completed the problems, these assignments should take you very little time.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
%You will also receive a check-in email from me if you fail to have a complete homework journal on multiple occasions.
If you struggle significantly on the first quizzes or exams, I will ask you to bring your homework journal to office hours so I can review it. If you have not been keeping up with it, this will be part of my early progress report to your program advisers.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\textbf{Group Quizzes}}:

\noindent
This course follows a strict policy of \textbf{no books, notes, or calculators} on quizzes. However, all of these materials are encouraged when studying and completing in-class or out-of-class practice activities to \textit{check your work} (or for difficult arithmetic which sometimes cannot be avoided).

Quizzes will be completed in small (3-4 person), preassigned groups.
You will take each quiz \textit{individually} for 20-25 minutes.
You will hand it in, and your group will be given another copy of the quiz to complete together.
You will use the remainder of the time to complete the second copy together.
\textbf{Your individual mark will be an average of your individual and group marks.}
The group quiz feedback will be available on D2L.
\vspace{1em}

\noindent\underline{\textbf{``Chapter" Exams (3)}}:

\noindent
Exams will consist of a two-stage process this semester.
\begin{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
The out of class portion will account for 35\% of your total exam score, and the in class portion will contribute the other 65\%.

For calculations of your final course grade, your \textit{best} exam average will count as 18\%, your second best exam average will count as 14\%, and your lowest exam average will only be counted as 11\%. The course website, D2L, is incapable of supporting this grading scheme, so students will need to \textit{keep track of their own grade progress}.

%\hl{\textbf{RESUME EDITING HERE !!!!!}}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\underline{\textbf{Final Project}}:

\noindent
Your final project will be to construct a creative work. This could be (but is not limited to) an infographic, a comic book, a sculpture, or a short film. A rubric for this project will be posted mid-semester, but roughly it should:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Summarize a significant portion of course content knowledge and present it in a clear, concise, and creative manner.
  \item Draw connections between different concepts in the course, and quickly describe the links \textit{for reference}. This is not a document you would use to \textit{teach} the content, but is something that \textit{demonstrates your knowledge and expertise in the content to your classmates and instructor}.
  \item This will be due on the last day of class (Friday, May 2nd).
  \item There will be a list of \textit{minimum requirements}. If you \textit{significantly exceed} the requirements (demonstrating substantial effort and expertise), this assignment may be eligible to count for a larger percentage of your final course grade.
\end{itemize}


\vspace{1em}
\noindent\underline{\textbf{Optional Comprehensive Final Exam}}:

\noindent
This will take place Monday, May. 5th during your scheduled class time (so it will be the same length as previous exams, but have questions from the entire semester).
After taking it, you can decide if it should be graded.
If you choose to have your final exam graded, it \textit{will} replace your lowest test score, for better or worse. If you are happy with your grade on the first three exams, you do not need to take the comprehensive final. However, if you had one or two bad exams, you could \textit{significantly} raise your grade due to the adaptive grading scheme.

%\noindent\underline{\textbf{Required Practice}}:
%
%\noindent
%All students may submit \textbf{exam} corrections/revisions with reflections to improve their marks. These assignments will only be accepted and graded (a significant additional time commitment on my part) if you demonstrate a corresponding effort and time-commitment in mastering the course material.
%For your corrections to be marked, you must complete at least nine (9) of the following (the schedule may be found on Page 1):
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\setlength{\itemsep}{-.4em}
%  \item attend your instructor's office hours (counted up to 2x per week),
%  \item attend your MavPASS leader's office hours (counted up to 1x per week),
%  \item attend your MavPASS leader's practice sessions (counted up to 1x per week),
%  \item complete homework journal at time of check-in (counted once each quiz/exam).
%\end{enumerate}
