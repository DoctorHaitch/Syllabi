    <title>Course Delivery</title>
    <p>
      Sessions will be in person.
      Many classes will require you to complete a 'pre-class assignment' to be turned in at the start of class.
      Lectures will be interactive and often be interrupted or replaced by individual or small group practice.
      You are expected to participate in class.
      If you are having trouble understanding anything please feel free to raise your hand and ask about it,
      or discuss it with your peers during the group work times.
      If you are not comfortable doing this, please email me, visit my drop-in practice hours,
      schedule an appointment during office hours, or ask immediately after class.
