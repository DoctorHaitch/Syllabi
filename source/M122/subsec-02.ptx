    <p>
      Formally, being enrolled in MATH122 requires having passed MATH121 with a 'C' or better, or
      explicit consent of the instructor. Any student being found not to meet these requirements
      will automatically receive a failing grade at the end of the semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, Calculus II depends heavily on <alert>algebra</alert>, <alert>analytic geometry</alert>,
      <alert>trigonometry</alert> and your knowledge from <alert>Calculus I</alert>.
      Several review worksheets are posted on D2L Brightspace to help you recall the knowledge that
      will help you succeed in Calculus II this semester.
      A list of specific material that will be used to scaffold new knowledge can be found in the 
      Prerequisite Knowledge for Calculus II section: <xref ref="prerequisite-knowledge" />.
