    <title>Learning Outcomes</title>
    <p>Upon completion of this course students will have demonstrated
      <ol>
        <li>a working knowledge of Riemann integration theory and several specific applications. 
          This will build off material from <em>MATH121: Calculus I</em>.</li>
        <li>a working knowledge of sequences, series, and their relevance to calculus.</li>
        <li>their ability to memorize, derive, and practice facts (the derivatives and 
          antiderivatives of basic functions, for instance) and fundamental theorems.</li>
        <li>understanding what is going on behind the symbols by developing the patterns
          of thought and the problem-solving skills needed when dealing with problems involving
          continuous change and difficult integrals. If you limit yourself to memorizing facts
          and formulas, you will miss out on this very important part of the course, which makes
          calculus so important for so many application areas.
        </li>
        <li>team work skills by collaborating within a small group, towards completion of a
          common task or goal.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>TODO: Revise these and align some with The Ohio State Calculus Learning Outcomes</p>
