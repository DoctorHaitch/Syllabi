  <title>Learning Outcomes</title>
  <p>
    Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Demonstrate a conceptual understanding and computational proficiency in Riemann integration theory, including its specific applications such as area, volume, and physical modeling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Analyze and work with sequences and series, including power series and Taylor expansions, demonstrating both their mathematical structure and their application to problems in calculus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accurately recall and apply key calculus formulas and theorems, such as derivatives and antiderivatives of standard functions, while also demonstrating the ability to derive and interpret these results.
      </li>
      <li>
        Solve complex calculus problems by developing persistence, mathematical reasoning, and problem-solving strategies that go beyond memorizationâ€”focusing on understanding the underlying concepts of continuous change and integration techniques.
      </li>
      <li>
        Communicate mathematical reasoning clearly and effectively, both verbally and in writing, using appropriate terminology and notation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborate effectively with peers in group settings to explore ideas, solve problems, and achieve common learning goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gain confidence in using mathematics to model, analyze, and solve real-world problems in science, engineering, and other fields.
      </li>
    </ol>
