    <title>Course Outline</title>
    <p>
      A planned schedule for the semester is provided at the end of this document.
      This second semester course will cover Chapters 6 through 9 of the textbook officially adopted by our department
      as described in <xref ref="122SuggestedTexts"/>, although almost any modern Calculus textbook will serve for this section of the course.
      Please see it for important dates such as <alert>quizzes</alert> and <alert>exams</alert>.

      Roughly, our semester is organized to study the following questions (in order):
      <ol>
        <li>
          How can the relationships between integrals and derivatives help us model real-world phenomena?
          In general, how can integration help us calculate useful quantities?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>
        <li>
          What can we do when the anti-derivative is not obvious?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>
        <li>
          How do we work with curves that are not functions or perform Calculus in other coordinate systems?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>
        <li>
          How do we deal with quantities involving infinity that still result in finite answers?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, when our techniques from answering (2) fail (or are impossible), can we still
          find meaningful answers to Calculus questions? If so, how?
          (Sections xx)
        </li>
      </ol>
