    <title>Course Outline</title>
    <p>
      A planned schedule for the semester is provided at the end of this document.
      This second semester course will cover Chapters 6 through 9 of the textbook officially adopted by our department
      as described in <xref ref="122SuggestedTexts"/>, although almost any modern Calculus textbook will serve for this section of the course.
      Please see it for important dates such as <alert>quizzes</alert> and <alert>exams</alert>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roughly, our semester is organized to study the following questions (in order):
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
          How can the relationships between integrals and derivatives help us model real-world phenomena?
          In general, how can integration help us calculate useful quantities?
          </p>
          <p>
          <ul><li>Sections 7.7: Intro to DEs; 7.1: Area Between Curves; 7.2: Volumes; 7.3: Cyl. Shells</li></ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What can we do when the anti-derivative is not obvious?</p>
          <p>
            <ul><li>Sections 6.1: IBP; 6.3: Partial Fractions; 6.2: Trig Integrals and General Substitutions</li></ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How do we work with curves that are not functions or perform Calculus in other coordinate systems?</p>
          <p><ul><li>Sections 9.1: Parametric Curves; 9.2: Calc. on Parametric Curves; 7.4 &amp; 9.2: Arc Length; 9.3: Polar Coordinates; 9.4: Areas and Lengths in Polar</li></ul></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>How do we deal with quantities involving infinity that still result in finite answers?</p>
          <p><ul><li>Sections 8.1: Sequences; 8.2: Series; 6.6: Improper Integrals; 8.3: Integral Test; 8.4: Alternating Series Test and Absolute Convergence; 8.4: Ratio/Root Tests</li></ul></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Finally, when our techniques from answering (2) fail (or are impossible), can we still
          find meaningful answers to Calculus questions? If so, how?</p>
          <p><ul><li>Sections 8.5: Power Series; 8.6: Fxns as Power Series; 8.7: Taylor and Maclaurin Series; 8.8: Appl. of Taylor Polynomials</li></ul></p>
        </li>
      </ol>
