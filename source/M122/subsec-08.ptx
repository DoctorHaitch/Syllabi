  <p>
    The textbook officially adopted by the department for this course is:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals</em> by James Stewart, <m>2^{\textrm{nd}}</m> edition.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <alert>ISBN</alert>: 978-1133112280
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    However, since the Learning Problems will be given as PDF files on D2L BrightSpace,
    almost any Calculus textbook will suffice. This includes any edition of Stewart's texts,
    freely available <alert>Open Educational Resource</alert> (OER) options from sites like OpenStax, and others.
    The most important consideration is the <em>order</em> of topics.
    For example, Stewart's textbooks typically present advanced integration techniques before the applications of integration,
    while this course takes the reverse approach—motivating techniques through early applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    A textbook that follows a similar order to this course is <em>Calculus</em> by Larson and Edwards
    (currently in its 12th edition, though any edition will work).
    Students looking for an affordable physical textbook might consider an older edition of Larson and Edwards.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another strong and inexpensive alternative closely aligned with the departmental textbook is:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <url href="http://www.apexcalculus.com/">APEX Calculus</url> by Gregory Hartman.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <alert>ISBN</alert>: 978-1719263382
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This book is freely available online and as a downloadable PDF.
    Print copies can typically be purchased for $15–$20 via Amazon.
    We will primarily cover content from Calculus 2, with a few sections drawn from Calculus 3.
    If you prefer a printed textbook, APEX Calculus Volume 2 is likely sufficient;
    the few Calculus 3 topics we cover can be accessed digitally.
  </p>
  <remark>
    <p>
    Please be aware, that if you continue into Calculus 3, you may still be required to purchase the
    current edition of Stewart's Calculus to obtain access to the digital homework system used by other instructors.
    These alternatives are provided in this section as a low-cost alternative to Stewart's Calculus.
