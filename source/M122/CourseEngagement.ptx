  <title>Course Engagement and Delivery</title>

  <p>
    This course will be delivered in person. Active engagement is essential to your success, and students are expected to participate fully during each class session. Most class periods will include lectures punctuated by individual or small-group problem solving. Students will regularly be asked to suggest next steps or provide answers during worked examples. In some sessions, collaborative group work may fully replace lecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    Continuous engagement with this course is essential to learning the material and achieving the course learning outcomes. You are expected to check D2L Brightspace at least once every 24 hours on weekdays. While we understand that you have commitments outside this class, to be successful in this course you should plan to work on it every school day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Early in the semester, frequent <em>pre-class assignments</em> will be assigned, with additional ones distributed periodically throughout the term. These are due at the beginning of the next class period. Pre-class assignments are intended to prepare you for in-class activities, reinforce recent material, assess your progress in writing clear mathematical solutions, and support long-term goals such as the final project by breaking them into manageable stages.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are frequent deadlines posted in D2L, and it is your responsibility to keep track of all due dates. You are encouraged to work ahead of those deadlines whenever possible to avoid last-minute issues. Regular attendance at all lecture meetings is expected and strongly contributes to your success.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are encouraged to ask questions whenever you encounter difficulties. You may raise your hand during class, talk with peers during group work, or seek assistance outside of class. If you are more comfortable seeking help privately, you are welcome to email the instructor, attend office hours (either individually or in a small group), schedule a one-on-one meeting, or ask questions immediately after class.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are unable to attend class or participate due to serious illness (including COVID-19 or other health conditions), you should contact your instructor as soon as possible to make arrangements. You should also reach out to
