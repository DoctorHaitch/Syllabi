    <title>Why study calculus?</title>
    <p>
      This rigorous mathematical subject consists of a basic mathematical tool kit for dealing with
      processes that change continuously.
      Part of the reason that calculus turns out to be so useful is that the details of the process
      turn out not to matter so much -- all that matters is that the process is continuous.
      In fact, if the increments are small enough, discrete processes can sometimes be approximated as
      continuous and treated using the techniques of calculus.
      More specifically, Calculus is the story of infinitely improving approximations concerned with
      two historical problems:
      <ol>
        <li>The slope of a "curvy line" at a point.</li>
        <li>The area beneath a "curvy line".</li>
      </ol>
      Miraculously, these two problems, which may seem barely related except for the type of line they
      seek to study, turn out to be deeply intertwined.
      This semester, we will primarily focus on the second problem, but due to the dual nature of these
      problems the other is necessary and a skill which you hopefully developed during Calculus I.

    In order to do well in <em>MATH122</em>, you need to work on developing both conceptual understanding and
    algebraic fluency.
    Conceptual understanding is necessary as memorized facts are not much help if you do not know how to use them.
    Algebraic fluency is required as knowing the basic concepts is not very helpful if you are unable to easily
    use them because your knowledge is not built on a firm foundation of the governing principles.

    By fluency, I mean that you can generally use them
    without thinking about them. Fluency is defined as the ability to speak or write a language <alert>easily</alert> and 
    <alert>accurately</alert>. Similar to your fluency in your native language, where you likely are fluent in 10000-20000 words,
    you are expected to be fluent in a number of "mathematical rules" which you have learned over the last several years.
    In <xref ref="prerequisite-knowledge" />, there is a full inventory of the algebraic, trigonometric, and Calculus I
    skills with which you need to be fluent to be truly successful in this and future courses.
