  <title>Grade Appeals Policy</title>

  <p>
    Students have the right to ask an instructor for an explanation of any grade received.
    Grade appeals are reviewed in instances where students perceive that a final course grade is <alert>unfair</alert>,
    <alert>arbitrary</alert>, or <alert>capricious</alert>.
    Students must begin the procedures of this policy within two weeks* of university notification of a final course grade.
  </p>

  <note>
    <p>*The time period consists of <em>normal university operating days</em> when classes are held.
        Under unusual circumstances, deadlines may be extended.
        If the University representative, at any step, fails to review and/or respond within the time limits provided,
        the student may proceed to the next step. If the student fails to respond within the time limits provided,
        the appeal shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. 
    </p>
    </note>

  <p>
    Students should retain copies of all materials associated with this process for their records.
    Students should also have records of their coursework from the class as part of the appeal process and
    be able to clearly explain why they believe their letter grade assignment does not align with
    university grading policies as outlined in <xref ref="univ-grading" />.
