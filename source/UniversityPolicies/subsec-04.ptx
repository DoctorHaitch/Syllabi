  <title>Electronic Recording of Lectures</title>
  
  <remark>
    <p>
      This policy exists to protect the use of copyrighted materials included in this course. Recording, sharing, or distributing course content without explicit permission may violate copyright laws. Such actions can result in disciplinary measures by the university and may also carry legal consequences. Additionally, uploading course materials to websites such as Chegg without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited and constitutes a copyright violation.
    </p>
  </remark>
  <p>
    Students are not permitted to record lectures or make electronic copies of course materials
    (e.g., slides, formulas, lecture notes) using personal recording devices (e.g., smart phone, tablet, computer, digital recorder)
    unless prior written permission from faculty is obtained and students who appear in the recordings or course materials do not object.
    The policy applies to all forms of course delivery (e.g., on-campus, online).
  </p>
  <p>
    Student attendance in a FlexSync course implies student consent to be recorded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Permission is limited to a student’s educational use during a course.
    Recordings and materials must be destroyed at the end of each term.
    Students who do not destroy recordings and materials may be subject to disciplinary action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unauthorized downloading, file sharing, distribution of all or part of a recorded lecture
    or course materials or using information for purposes other than the student's own learning
    may be deemed a violation of this policy and subject to disciplinary action.
  </p>
  <p><alert>ADA Accomodations</alert></p>
  <p>
    In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), students may record and retain classroom lectures and instructional materials as part of an approved accommodation plan coordinated by the Office of Accessibility Resources in consultation with the student and faculty. However, as stated elsewhere in this policy, recorded lectures or copied materials must be destroyed at the end of each term.
