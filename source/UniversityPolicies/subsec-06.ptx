  <title>University Sponsored or Sanctioned Activities and Makeup Work</title>

  <p>
    Students represent the university through participation in university-sponsored or -sanctioned activities,
    i.e. representing the university at off-campus co-curricular events. When the activity conflicts with academic
    obligations, student-participants will follow a standard protocol to provide their faculty members with prior,
    written notification of their absences from classes. Faculty members will determine, in consultation with
    student participants, how missed classes and assignments are made-up in a manner that fulfills academic
    obligations and accommodates participatory obligations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Except for absences resulting from sponsored or sanctioned activities, student-participants have the same
    responsibility in regard to class attendance and assignments as do all other students.
