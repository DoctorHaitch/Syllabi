  <title>University Grading Policy</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A student's <alert>work</alert> in any course will be evaluated to align with the following university grade system and governing policies.
      Final gradelines as a percent grade may be modified to better reflect these expectations, but <em>only</em> in students' favor if
      gradelines are already provided in the individual course description.

  <remark>
    <p>
      Graduate students should be aware that while the Instructor’s Description of assignments and grading remains consistent for both undergraduate and graduate students (as indicated in the third column), the University’s Description of letter grades differs. Specifically, graduate students are held to a higher academic standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the graduate level, the minimum acceptable performance is considered “above average” by university standards. This means that simply fulfilling the basic requirements of an assignment may not be sufficient for a high grade. Graduate students are expected to demonstrate a deeper, more critical understanding of course material, engage with concepts at a higher level of abstraction, and communicate their insights with clarity, precision, and intellectual rigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, graduate-level work demands stronger metacognitive skills—such as the ability to reflect on one’s own learning, identify areas for growth, and adjust approaches accordingly. These heightened expectations align with the broader goals of graduate education: to cultivate independent thinkers, researchers, and professionals capable of contributing original ideas to their field.
    </p>
    <p>
      While course content and assignments may overlap in cross-listed undergraduate/graduate courses, graduate students are evaluated by more rigorous standards, particularly in terms of depth of analysis, scholarly engagement, and critical thinking.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    The grade of <alert>Incomplete</alert> (I) is reserved for special cases.
    A student and instructor must complete and sign an <alert>Incomplete Contract</alert>
    that specifies the assigned grade of "I" for the course and outlines requirements for its completion.
