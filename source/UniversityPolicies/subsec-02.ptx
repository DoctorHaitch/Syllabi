  <title>Credit Hours Policy</title>

  <p>
    According to university policy, each credit hour represents one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of independent student work per week, typically over a 15-week semester. This applies equally to traditional semester-long courses and to accelerated or alternative delivery formats, which must involve the same total amount of learning time.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practical terms, this means that for a standard 3-credit course, you should plan to spend 6–9 hours per week outside of class actively engaging with course material. For a 4-credit course, the expectation rises to 8–12 hours weekly. This time includes reading, working on practice problems, completing assignments, reviewing notes, visiting office hours or other academic support systems, and preparing for exams.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regular, distributed practice is essential for learning complex material like mathematics. Research in cognitive science consistently shows that spreading out your study time—rather than condensing it into long, infrequent sessions—leads to better long-term retention and deeper understanding. Setting aside 1–2 hours each day to review concepts and complete coursework is far more effective than a single weekly “cram session.”

  <p>
    Making time for consistent, focused practice is not just about keeping up with assignments—it's about training your brain to think mathematically. By returning to material frequently, you give yourself repeated opportunities to reinforce knowledge and make meaningful connections, both of which are essential for academic success.
