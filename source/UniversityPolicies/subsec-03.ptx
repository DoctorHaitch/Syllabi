  <title>Academic Honesty Policy</title>

  <p>
    As members of the university community, students are expected to fulfill their
    academic responsibilities with integrity and honesty. This includes avoiding misconduct
    such as plagiarism, cheating, or collusion. Violations of academic honesty may result
    in both academic consequences (such as a lowered grade or failing the course) and
    disciplinary actions (such as probation, suspension, or expulsion).
