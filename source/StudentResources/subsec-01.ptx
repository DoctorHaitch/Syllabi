  <title>Maverick Textbook Reserve Program</title>
  <p>
    Students who cannot or do not wish to purchase a textbook for a class may be able to utilize the Maverick Textbook Reserve Program 
    (the <em>Essential Calculus</em> book by James Stewart is available). The program was created to address the financial burden of textbook costs 
    and is offered through a partnership between Student Government, the Bookstore, and the Library.

    The Maverick Textbook Reserve purchases textbooks and houses them in the library for students to check out in two-hour time blocks. 
    To see what other books are offered, you can visit the circulation desk in the library or explore the list online:
