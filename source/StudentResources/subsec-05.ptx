  <p>
    Minnesota State University, Mankato provides students with disabilities reasonable accommodation
    to participate in educational programs, activities, or services. 
    These include both <alert>permanent</alert> and <alert>temporary</alert> disabilities.
    Students requiring accommodation to engage in class activities or meet course requirements should
    first register with Accessibility Resources 
    (Memorial Library 132, telephone 389-2825, TDD 711) to establish an accommodation plan.
    After that, they should contact me for any needed course-specific arrangements.
