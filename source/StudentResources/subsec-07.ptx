  <title>Maverick Food Pantry</title>

  <p>
    The Maverick Food Pantry is an important campus initiative that provides both
    perishable and non-perishable food, as well as basic toiletries, to students experiencing
    food insecurity. No student should have to choose between eating and learning. Good
    nutrition is a critical foundation for academic performance—affecting energy levels,
    focus, memory, and overall well-being.

  <p>
    If you're not getting enough to eat, it can significantly hinder your ability to concentrate,
    retain information, and stay motivated. Addressing food insecurity is not just about physical
    health—it's about supporting your success as a student. The Maverick Food Pantry exists to ensure
    that all students have the fuel they need to thrive academically and personally.
